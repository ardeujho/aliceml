<H2>Overview</H2>

  <P>
    SEAM (Simple Extensible Abstract Machine) is a
    virtual machine architecture and library. SEAM is designed to be
    language- and platform-independent, to be simple
    and based on few principled services.

  <LI><EM>Uniform data representation and memory management.</EM>
      All datastructures used to represent computations, including code and
      threads, reside in an <EM>abstract store</EM>, which represents
      an abstract graph of data nodes.
      Language specific datastructures are modelled on top of the
      language-independent store structures. The store manages the allocation
      of nodes and their efficient layout in memory.
  <LI><EM>Platform-independent external representation.</EM>
      Store values are converted to a portable representation during
      export (<EM>pickling</EM>), and converted back during
      import (<EM>unpickling</EM>). A language-independent
      <EM>transfer language</EM> is defined
      to describe values independent from platform.
      Unpickling operates with respect to runtime-pluggable
      language-dependent transformation. For example, language specific code
      can be instantiated either to byte code or to native code.
  <LI><EM>Abstract execution model.</EM>
      Computations are defined by a generic <EM>evaluator interface</EM>.
      SEAM supports arbitrarily many codes and
      evaluators to be used at the  same time and interact freely. In particular,
      common virtual machine services like foreign
      function interfaces are easily expressible.

  <P>SEAM is used successfully to implement the new virtual machine underlying
     the <A href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/">Alice Programming System</A>.
