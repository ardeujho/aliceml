<H2>Anonymous CVS</H2>


<P><B>Warning:</B> It is quite likely that development snapshots might have
bugs, they might not even build! You are basically on your own.</P>

<H3>CVS information</H3>

<P>In order to be able to build SEAM, you will need to checkout two modules,
<TT>seam-support</TT> and <TT>seam</TT>.
</P>

<PRE class=code>
CVSROOT:  :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de:/services/alice/CVS
Module:   seam-support
Password: anoncvs

CVSROOT:  :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de:/services/alice/CVS
Module:   seam
Password: anoncvs
</PRE>


<H3>Example session</H3>

<P>An example session to check out the whole SEAM source tree
   might look as follows:</P>

<PRE class=code>
% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de:/services/alice/CVS login
(Logging in to anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de)
CVS password: anoncvs
% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de:/services/alice/CVS get seam-support seam</PRE>

<!--
<P>From the CVS repository you can also access the released version:</P>

<PRE class=code>
% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.ps.uni-sb.de:/services/alice/CVS get -r release-0-9-3 alice</PRE>
-->

<H2>Building SEAM</H2>

<P>Building SEAM on Windows currently requires the cygwin environment.
The resulting binaries, however, do not need the cygwin dll.
</P>
<P>Building SEAM requires to first build the <TT>seam-support</TT> module.
To do so, execute:
</P>
<PRE>
cd seam-support && ./build.sh
</PRE>
<P>On Windows, you will need to edit <TT>build.sh</TT> and change the line
from <TT>BUILD_GMP=0</TT> to <TT>BUILD_GMP=1</TT>
to have the GNU gmp library built.
Finally add <TT>seam-support/install/bin</TT> to your path.
</P>
<P>Now you can proceed to building SEAM. Executing
</P>
<PRE>
cd seam && make -f Makefile.cvs
</PRE>
will setup the Makefiles and configure scripts. Now you can use
<TT>configure</TT> to perform the platform-specific setup. An example
invocation on Windows might look like:
<PRE>
mkdir build
cd build
../seam/configure \
  CXX='g++ -mno-cygwin -DS_IXOTH=S_IXUSR -DS_IXGRP=S_IXUSR' \
  CXXFLAGS='-mcpu=pentium3 -march=pentium3' \
  CC='gcc -mno-cygwin -DS_IXOTH=S_IXUSR -DS_IXGRP=S_IXUSR' \
  CFLAGS='-mcpu=pentium3 -march=pentium3' \
  --prefix=../seam-install \
  --with-warnings=yes \
  --with-zlib=../seam-support/install
make install
</PRE>
<P>On unix like operating systems,
the <TT>(g++|gcc) -mno-cygwin -DS_IXOTH=S_IXUSR -DS_IXGRP=S_IXUSR</TT>
collapses to <TT>(g++|gcc)</TT>.
</P>
