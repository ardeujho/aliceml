Automake for Seam
=================

This is a patched version of automake 1.7.6 that eases the development
of SEAM language layers.

This is achieved by supporting one new primary: SEAMLIBRARIES

It can be used for example in the following way:

seamlib_SEAMLIBRARIES = foo.dll
foo_dll_SOURCES = foo.cc

This Makefile.am is enough to build a library foo.dll from the
corresponding source file and install it in the preferred seamlib
path. For this to work, the configure.ac of your project should
contain a test for seamtool (as is provided by the seam.m4 file in the
main SEAM distribution).
