To build a rpm package for the alice-gecode binding 1.3, you need a rpm
package for gecode 1.1.0.

Download the gecode sources 1.1.0 from http://www.gecode.org

To build the package, just invoke

./build-rpm gecode-1.1.0.tar.gz gecode.spec

Install the resulting rpm package with

rpm -Uhv gecode-1.1.0-1.i386.rpm

Now, you can start the packaging process for Alice and the dependencies to
gecode are automatically configured by rpm.

Note: This process should also work for newer Gecode release. You only have to 
adjust the "Version" field in gecode.spec accordingly.
