Prerequisites:
--------------

You need a version of Alice installed (www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice) to build the ant compiler.

Unfortunately, you need the CVS version of Alice on Seam to build the simulator (because of the version of the Gtk binding used).


Building the compiler:
----------------------

Do

  make depend compiler

You can then compile .ante into .ant files using

  ./compile file.ante

Beware, error handling is rudimentary. Usually you will be rewarded with an uncaught exception.. ;-)


Building the simulator:
-----------------------

Will not work with the release version of Alice!

Do

  (cd parsec && make depend && make)
  make EXT=alc depend simulator

Run the simulator with

  ./sim -v black.ant red.ant arena.world
