TestAliceParser
===============

This is intended to be the *big* aliceyacc, alicelex testcase.  By entering
make a file called TestAliceParser.alc will be produced.  Run it by calling

alicerun TestAliceParser SomeAliceSourceFile.aml  

It will just test the parser with the both a alicelex and a ml-lex generated
lexer.

Note that compiling the Parser will take a really long time:

[0]dreamer:lexyacc_test> alicec --no-warn-conventions --dump-phases AliceParser.aml 
-- Parsing... 8.114 secs
-- Abstraction... 6.441 secs
-- Elaboration... AliceParser.aml:2.17-2.25: warning: imported structure LrParser is not used and
has been dropped
965.531 secs
-- Translation... 2.62 secs
-- Verification (optional)... 0.0 secs
-- Flattening... AliceParser.aml:12313.8-12315.0: warning:
match is not exhaustive, because e.g.
    ABSTYPE
is not covered
16.874 secs
-- Value Propagation... 12.062 secs
-- Liveness Analysis... 1.14 secs
-- Code Generation... 1.441 secs

As you can see this takes about 14 - 16 minutes (on my machine a 1.6 Centrino 
Laptop with 768 Megabytes of RAM).  

Note that right now this parser also takes more time to parse a file than
the one used in alice.
