Alice 1.0 (Kraftwerk Album 1) - 2004/12/22
------------------------------------------

Runtime system:

* Completely new VM called SEAM (Simple Efficient Abstract Machine).
  It uses just-in-time compilation and a 3-generation garbage collector,
  rendering it up to 5 times faster than Alice on Mozart.
* Completely new, extended constraint library based on GECODE
  (Generic Constraint Development Environment). It provides advanced
  global constraints (like global cardinality, sortedness, counting,
  lexicographic ordering) not found in Mozart, set selection
  constraints, and batch recomputation. The new library is more than
  10 times faster than constraints in the Mozart-based versions of Alice.
* Mozart is no longer required to run Alice (and no longer compatible with it).

Language:

* Syntactic sugar for finalization.
* Nicer syntax (derived forms) for functors.
* Lazy and spawn syntax for modules.
* Pack can now use a transparent annotation, as this is usually more convenient.
* Fully dynamic component typing: link-time type checking now is fully
  parametric in abstract import types and takes into account the *dynamic*
  types exported by respective components. This implies at least two things:
  - Less need for recompilation. Recompilation of a component exporting
    abstract types no longer forces recompilation of dependent components.
  - Smooth interaction with pickles. Abstract types in compiled components are
    no longer incompatible with abstract types in pickled components.

Compiler:

* Dynamic sealing has been implemented.
* Warn about unused imports (switch --(no-)warn-unused-imports).
* Warn about inaccessible type and signature names appearing in inferred
  component signature (switch --(no-)warn-inaccessible-exports).
* Inaccessible types occuring in inferred /import/ signatures are now an error.
* To accommodate with the new dynamic import typing, the compiler now closes
  over all implicit import signatures, by potentially inserting additional
  imports for abstract types and signatures imported transitively. Optional
  warnings for added imports (switch --warn-added-imports).
* Support for smart recompilation, taking component signatures into account.

Linker:

* Rewritten to soundly support dynamic component typing.
* Disallow cyclic linking.
* Print free type names appearing in component signature with -d option.

Interactive Toplevel:

* Enable Ctrl-C for interrupting a computation.
* Enable Ctrl-Z for putting a computation into background (new Alice thread).
* Function exit() as an alternative for Ctrl-D in broken environments.
* Value printer is customizable for abstract types.

Library:

* Constraint library now based on Gecode.
  - State-of-the-art global constraints for finite domain integers
    (all-distinct, global cardinality, sortedness, lexicographic ordering)
  - Finite set selection constraints
  - More reified constraints for finite sets
  - Support for batch recomputation, improving the performance of search
    engines considerably
  - Significant interface changes; in particular, computation spaces are now
    explicit
* Component:
  - Added fromPackage.
  - Create now takes a functor as argument to support unevaluated components.
  - Added exception Internal.
* ComponentManager:
  - Added load function.
  - Functions eval and link return packages now.
  - Link and link are no longer lazy.
  - Removed start (equivalent to ignore o link).
  - logStream reference to configure trace destinations. Preconfigurable
    through value of ALICE_TRACE_COMPONENT.
  - Trace messages are more informative, particularly wrt signature mismatches.
* Toplevel: Future.await is now available unqualified.
* Default int type is now 31 bit, infinite precision integers are
  available through the IntInf structure.
* FixedInt added.
* Word32 added. LargeWord = Word32 now, but Word = Word31 remains.
* Time: now, fromString, toString, fmt, scan added.
* Date added.
* Timer added.
* Exn: new structure for dealing with exceptions and backtraces.
* OS.Process: atExn takes an Exn.packet now.
* Hole: fixed semantics of synchronisation on holes.
* Hole: future now simply returns argument if not a hole (no exception).
* Promise: fulfilling with a cycle no longer fails the promise.
* Alt: added mapBoth.
* Pair: added mapBoth.
* VectorSlice: fixed toVector.
* String: fixed isSubstring.
* Substring: fixed isSubstring.
* StringCvt: fixed pad{Left,Right}.
* ByNeed: moved to Future structure.
* Future: added ByNeed and Concur functors.
* Package: deleted separate val_package type.
* Channel: new module for concurrent message channels.
* RefMap: new module for stable polymorphic hash tables over references.
* Print: added function register for hooking user-defined printing functions.
* Config: added buildDate.
* Remote:
  - Added functor Proxy to conveniently wrap a whole module into proxies.
  - Added function execute, made the Execute functor a trivial wrapper.
* Minimizer: new structure for minimizing the heap representation of
  Alice values.
* Gtk binding updgraded to Gtk 2.2, with some interface changes.

Tools:

* Reimplemented inspector:
  - Type tooltips.
  - Inspection of modules.
  - Indicates sharing between references, futures, etc.
  - User-defined layout for abstract types.
  - Many miscellaneous improvements to user interface.
* Reimplemented explorer:
  - Auto-zooming.
  - Anti-aliasing.
  - Support for visualizing distributed search.
