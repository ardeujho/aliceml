We are happy to announce version 1.2 of the Alice programming
system:

     http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/

Alice ML is a functional programming language that enriches the
statically typed, closed functional world of ML with extensive
support for type-safe programming of concurrent, distributed
and open systems. It also features cutting-edge constraint
programming technology in the tradition of Oz/Mozart.

Alice ML is a mostly conservative extension of Standard ML
featuring:

  Futures
     selective laziness and light-weight concurrency with
     implicit dataflow synchronisation
  Higher-order modules
     higher-order functors and abstract signatures
  Packages
     dynamically typed ML modules as first-class values
  Pickling
     type-safe, generic & platform-independent marshalling,
     including code, types and entire modules
  Components
     type-safe lazy dynamic linking across the Internet
  Distribution
     type-safe remote functions and network mobility
  Constraints
     constraint propagation and programmable search for
     solving hard combinatorical problems
  Virtual Machine
     portable implementation with just-in-time compilation
  Interactive tools
     graphical browsers for data structures and search spaces

The highlights of this release are:

  New Byte Code Jitter
     optimized internal byte code produced by jitting, which is
     a lot faster than non-jitted code; unlike native code jitting
     it is available on all platforms
  Improvements to Interactive Toplevel
     many tweaks and fixes in the GUI; new features include type hints,
     and native look&feel on Windows (thanks to Gtk Wimp theme)
  Overhaul of Gecode Constraint Library
     many, many bug fixes in Gecode implementation and binding;
     simplified interface to set constraints
  Overhaul of Gtk Graphics Library
     re-structured into submodules with proper dynamic type checking;
     upgraded to Gtk 2.6, including bindings to GLib, Pango, and Atk
  Regular Expression Library
     a simple binding to the GNU Regex library is now included
  64 Bit Support
     Alice can now support 64 bit architectures; a first package
     is available for Debian AMD 64
  Bug Fixes
     lots of bug fixes and minor improvements all over the place
