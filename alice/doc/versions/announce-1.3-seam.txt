We are happy to announce version 1.3 of the Alice programming
system:

     http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/

Alice ML is a functional programming language that enriches the
statically typed, closed functional world of ML with extensive
support for type-safe programming of concurrent, distributed
and open systems. It also features cutting-edge constraint
programming technology based on the Gecode library.

Alice ML is a mostly conservative extension of Standard ML
featuring:

  Futures
     selective laziness and light-weight concurrency with
     implicit dataflow synchronisation
  Higher-order modules
     higher-order functors and abstract signatures
  Packages
     dynamically typed ML modules as first-class values
  Pickling
     type-safe, generic & platform-independent marshalling,
     including code, types and entire modules
  Components
     type-safe lazy dynamic linking across the Internet
  Distribution
     type-safe remote functions and network mobility
  Constraints
     constraint propagation and programmable search for
     solving hard combinatorial problems with Gecode
  Virtual Machine
     portable implementation with just-in-time compilation
  Interactive tools
     graphical browsers for data structures and search spaces

The highlights of this release are:

  Constraint Tutorial
     an extensive tutorial on Constraint Programming using the
     Alice binding to the Gecode library [www.gecode.org] has
     been added to the documentation
  New Byte Code Jitter
     internal byte code jitting is now the default, with smaller
     memory footprint and more aggressive dynamic optimizations
  Successor ML
     integrated proposals for Successor ML [www.successor-ml.org],
     in particular extensible records and line comments
  Bug Fixes
     as always, bug fixes and minor improvements everywhere
