We are happy to announce the release of version 0.9.2 of
the Alice Programming System. It is available from the
Alice home page:

        http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/

This version is a bug fix release that also features
significant extensions to the library. The compiler now
has special support for importing plain SML code. For a
detailed list of changes, see:

Also, we recently set up a page that is intended to list
libraries and tools contributed by the user community:

If you developed something useful and want to make it
available to others, do not hesitate to mail a suitable
link to the Webmaster.

Enjoy,
