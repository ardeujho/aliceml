\section{Introduction}
This article presents a
simple, efficient, extensible, platform-independent
framework for the execution and interoperation of multiple languages
in an open system.
\subsection{State of the Art}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Current vm do not scale well on different platforms. Java uses
different implementations (HotSpot Server, PC)
\item Hard-Wired bytecode representation
optimized for one host language (eg, JAVA, c\#)
\item Other Language ports need to fit into the architecture.
\item Fitting involves large overheads (eg. dml, mozart.net, sml.java)
\item Bad extensibility with respect to languages and services
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Our Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simple
\item Widely Platform indepedenent (many platforms types: PC, SERVER, PDA)
\item Open multi-language platform
\item Ability to plug-in interpreters during runtime
\item Result: simple but extremly powerful
\item Language Interpreter might optimize like crazy. Tradeoffs only for
interop case.
\item competitive performance to mozart/alice, maybe mozart/oz. other bytecode
based environments?
\item Extensibility wrt. languages and services
\item Concept: express services simple and in cooperation with the system
primitives (Interpreter)
\end{enumerate}
