<?php section("description", "description") ?>

<P>The analyzer tool takes a list of source files and writes
<TT>make</TT>-compatible dependency information to standard output.</P>

<P>For each given source file the tool generates one <TT>make</TT>-style rule.
The rule's target is the path of the file relative to the current working
directory, with an appropriate extension. To determine the rule's prerequisites
the tool scans all <A href="components.html#source">import announcements</A> in
the source file. Imports from URIs that have a scheme different from
<TT>file:</TT> are ignored (note that URIs without a scheme are implicitly
assumed to have file schemes). For each file URI an appropriate prerequisite is
generated. Relative paths are resolved with respect to the location of the
source file.</P>


<?php section("environment-variables", "environment variables") ?>

<P>The dependency analyzer is parameterized by the same environment variables
as the <A href="machine.html#environment-variables">virtual machine</A>.</P>
