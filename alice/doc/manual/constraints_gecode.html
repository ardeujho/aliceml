<P>Constraint-based problem solving is a technique for solving hard
combinatorial problems that can be stated as variables ranging over a finite
domain of non-negative integers, or sets thereof. Problems in this class range
from puzzles to real world applications as diverse as scheduling, ware house
allocation, configuration and placement.</P>

<P>The two basic techniques of constraint programming are <EM>constraint
propagation</EM> and <EM>constraint distribution</EM>. Constraint propagation
is an efficient inference mechanism obtained with concurrent propagators
accumulating information in a <EM>constraint store</EM>. Constraint
distribution splits a problem into complementary cases once constraint
propagation cannot advance further. By iterating propagation and distribution,
propagation will eventually determine the solutions of a problem.</P>

<P>Constraint distribution can easily lead to an exponential growth of the
number of subproblems to be considered. Fortunately, this potential
combinatorial explosion can often be contained by combining strong propagation
mechanisms with problem specific heuristics for selecting distribution
steps.</P>

<P>The Alice constraint programming features build upon the <A
href="http://www.gecode.org">Gecode</A> constraint library.

<?php subsection("introduction-example", "Example") ?>

<P>The following classic puzzle gives a first idea of the combinatorial
problems constraint programming can solve.</P>

<P>The <EM>Send More Money</EM> problem consists in finding distinct digits for
the letters <TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, <TT>D</TT>, <TT>M</TT>,
<TT>O</TT>, <TT>R</TT>, <TT>Y</TT> such that <TT>S</TT> and <TT>M</TT> are
different from zero (no leading zeros) and the equation</P>

<PRE class=code>
SEND + MORE = MONEY</PRE>

<P>is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem is 9567 + 1085 = 10652.</P>

<?php section("fd", "finite domain constraints") ?>

<P><EM>Finite domains constraints</EM> describe the set of values a
non-negative integer variable may take.</P>

<P>As a simple example of a complete program solving a finite domain problem,
consider the <I>Send More Money</I> problem. It consists in finding distinct
digits for the letters <TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, <TT>D</TT>,
<TT>M</TT>, <TT>O</TT>, <TT>R</TT>, <TT>Y</TT> such that <TT>S</TT> and
<TT>M</TT> are different from zero (no leading zeros) and the equation

<PRE class=code>
SEND + MORE = MONEY</PRE>

<P>is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem is <TT>9567 + 1085 =
10652</TT>.</P>

<P>Using Alice, the problem can be solved as follows. First, we have to define
a so-called <I>script</I> that encodes the problem:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun money sp =
let
    val v as #[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y] = fdtermVec (sp, 8, [0`#9])
in
    distinct (sp, v, FD.BND); 
    post (sp, S `&lt;&gt; `0, FD.BND); 
    post (sp, M `&lt;&gt; `0, FD.BND); 
    post (sp, `1000`*S `+ `100`*E `+ `10`*N `+ D `+
              `1000`*M `+ `100`*O `+ `10`*R `+ E `=
             `10000`*M `+ `1000`*O `+ `100`*N `+ `10`*E `+ Y, FD.BND); 
    branch (sp, v, FD.B_SIZE_MIN, FD.B_MIN); 
    {S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y}
end
<I><SMALL>val money :
   Modeling.space ->
      {D : term, E : term, M : term, N : term, O : term, R : term, S : term,
       Y : term} = _fn</SMALL></I></PRE>

<P>Constraint problems have to be formulated as a script, a unary
function taking a computation space and
posting the necessary constraints to that space. The script makes use
of the <TT>Modeling</TT> component to formulate the constraints
conveniently. See 
the description of the <A href="library/fd.html"><TT>FD</TT></A> and <A
href="library/modeling.html"><TT>Modelin</TT></A> structures for a detailed
description of the meaning of the above constraints.</P>

<P>The Send More Money problem cannot be solved using constraint propagation
alone. Search is required to reduce the problem space until constraint
propagation is able to determine the solution. The <TT>distribute</TT> function
in the script specifies the <I>distribution strategy</I> used when the problem
space has to be split for search. See the Mozart <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/">Constraint Programming
Tutorial</A> for a more detailed explanation of the basic concepts.</P>

<P>To perform the actual search and obtain all solutions to the problem,
predefined search engines can be used:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Search.searchAll money
<I><SMALL>### loaded signature from x-alice:/lib/gecode/Search
val it :
   Space.space list *
      {D : term, E : term, M : term, N : term, O : term, R : term, S : term,
       Y : term} =
   ([_val],
    {D = FD (_val), E = FD (_val), M = FD (_val), N = FD (_val), O = FD (_val),
     R = FD (_val), S = FD (_val), Y = FD (_val)})</SMALL></I></PRE>

<P>The actual solutions could now be extracted from the result record using the functions from the <A
href="library/fd.html"><TT>FD.Reflect</TT></A> library structure. However, the easiest way to obtain the solutions is to interactively explore the
search tree induced by the script using the <A
href="library/explorer.html"><EM>Explorer</EM></A> instead of offline <TT>Search</TT>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Explorer.exploreAll money
<I><SMALL>val it : unit = ()</SMALL></I></PRE>

<P align=center><IMG src="explorer.png" border=0 alt="Alice Explorer"></P>

<P>Double-clicking on the only solution node in the search tree (the green
diamond) will open an Inspector window displaying the variable assignments of
the solution.
</P>

<P align=center><IMG src="inspector-search-1.png" border=0 alt="Alice Inspector"></P>

<P>
Chosing an inner node will display the information available at
the respective point of the search tree.</P>

<?php section("fs", "finite set constraints") ?>

<P><EM>Finite set constraints</EM> describe the possible elements that can be
contained in the set denoted by a set variable.</P>

<P>Alice supports a wide range of <A href="library/fs.html">finite set
constraints</A>, including finite set selection constraints and
reified constraints.</P>

<?php section("spaces", "spaces") ?>

<P>Like Mozart, Alice supports the unique concept of first-class
<EM>computation spaces</EM> that can be used to program inference engines for
problem solving. See the <A href="library/space.html"><TT>Space</TT></A>
component for details.</P>
