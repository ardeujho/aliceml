    structure Search : SEARCH</PRE>

   <P>This section describes the search engines found in the structure
      <TT>Search</TT>. 
   </P>

   <P>
      Constraint problems have to be formulated as a script, a unary
      function taking as argument a computation space and posting the
      necessary constraints in this space. This script can then be
      passed to different search engines, which will return none, one
      or several solutions of the problem.
   </P>

   <P>Scripts which create a large number of variables or
      propagators or scripts for which the search tree is very deep might
      use too much memory to be feasible. The search engines described
      in this section feature support for so-called <EM>recomputation</EM>.
      Recomputation reduces the space requirements for these scripts
      in that it trades space for time. 
   </P>
   <P>Search engines that do not use recomputation create a copy of
      a computation space in each distribution step.
      This copy is needed such that the engine is able to follow more
      than one alternative of a choice. 
   </P>
   <P>If, for instance, a single solution search engine finds a
      solution after 200 distribution steps (i. e. the search tree has
      a depth of 201), 200 copies are created and stored by the engine. 
   </P>
   <P>Recomputation reduces the number of copies needed:
      Instead of creating a copy in each distribution step,
      only every <I>n</I>-th distribution step a copy is created.
      A space for which no copy has been created can be recomputed
      from a copy located higher above in the search tree by
      recomputing some distribution steps. In the worst case, <I>n</I>-1
      distribution steps have to be recomputed. The parameter <I>n</I>
      is the so-called <EM>recomputation distance</EM>.
   </P>
   <P>The following search engines take the recomputation distance
      as an argument (it is denoted by <I>rcd</I>).
      A value of <I>2</I> for <I>rcd</I> means that
      only each second distribution step a copy is created.
      The value <I>1</I> for <I>rcd</I> means that in each
      distrbution step a copy is created, that is no recomputation is used.
      Values less than <I>1</I> mean that none but an initial copy is created:
      from this initial copy all other spaces are recomputed. 
   </P>
   <P>Recomputation can also <EM>reduce</EM> both space and time requirements.
      Searching a single solution of a script which features a good heuristic
      (i. e. there are only very few failures) creates copies which are
      not used. Recomputation avoids this, resulting in improvement
      with respect to both space and time. 
   </P>
   <P>
     To get an idea on how search engines are programmed in Alice,
     take a look at the example given
     <A HREF="space.html">here</A>.

  <P>
    The search engines in the <TT>Recompute</TT> structure take the <I>mrd</I>
    (maximum recomputation distance) as an additional integer argument.
    Otherwise, they behave just like the search engines without recomputation.
