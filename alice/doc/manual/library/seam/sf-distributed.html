   <P>The <TT>MkEngine</TT> functor creates a search engine that
      performs search on several networked computers in parallel.
      It expects two arguments.
      The first one is a structure that provides the type of solutions of the distributed problem
      and a function <TT>toString</TT> to print them.
      The second one is a functor that creates a <A href="sf-problem.html"><TT>PROBLEM</TT></A>, given
      a local constraint library.</P>

   <P>Have a look at the <A href="#example">example</A> below.</P>

      </P>
      <P><TT>start hostList</TT> returns a pair <I>(shutdown, solutions)</I> as soon as all remote workers
         have been contacted.
         <I>shutdown</I> is a function that can be used to concurrently stop the search and stop remote workers.
         <I>solutions</I> is a channel, initially empty, that is filled with solutions as soon as they are discovered.
         In case of Branch & Bound, newer solutions are always better, so that the last one is the best.

<P>
<A name="example"></A>
The first step to create a distributed problem consists of creating a
local problem.
We take the <a href="sf-problem.html#examples">second example</a>
described in <TT>PROBLEM</TT>.
</P>

<P>
One may design, adjust, and test the local problem using
<A href="sf-search.html"><TT>SEARCH</TT></A>, which runs locally.
Once the programmer is happy with the problem, a straightforward
transformation is needed to make it "distributable".
Namely, the problem must be transformed into a functor receiving the
constraint library as an argument, as follows:
<PRE>
structure MkProblem : MK_PROBLEM = fct (Constraints : CONSTRAINTS) =>
let
  structure Space  = Constraints.Space
  structure FD     = Constraints.FD
  structure FS     = Constraints.FS
  structure Linear = Constraints.Linear
in
  struct
  ...
  end
end
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
This functorialization is necessary because the constraint library is
a local ressource. Thus, constraint problems cannot be transmitted over
the network as such. Their dependencies over the constraint library
must be abstracted first. On each remote worker, the local constraint
library will be acquired and the functor applied to them.
</P>

<P>
Note that your problem must not use any other local ressource.
In particular, it must not use <TT>print</TT>, which is sited.
Besides, in case of Branch & Bound, you must provide an implementation
for <TT>compare</TT>.
</P>
  
<P>
Then, the problem is distributed to remote workers by using
<TT>MkWorker</TT> and <TT>start</TT>.
The argument given to start is a list of pairs
<TT>(host, nickname)</TT>.
The nickname is only used for debug messages (they can be useful when
one remote machine runs several remote workers).
The host must have Alice installed.
