    signature SANDBOX
    structure Sandbox : SANDBOX</PRE>

  <P>
    This structure realises an experimental <EM>sandbox</EM> infrastructure
    for executing untrusted components.
    To this end, it provides a means to create
    <a href="component-manager.html">component managers</a> which can be
    customised over a set of <em><a href="policy.html">policy</a></em> rules.
  </P>

  <P>
    Sandboxing relies on the fact that
    <A href="../pickling.html#semantics">resources</A> cannot be pickled.
    A component can acquire relevant capabalities solely by means of
    linking suitable <a href="index.html#system">system components</A>.
    In a sandbox, link requests to such components are redirected to
    safe wrappers that implement runtime tests to enforce the configured
    policy.
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>Note:</B> The sandboxing mechanism should be
    understood as a
    proof-of-concept implementation, since some of the safety assumptions it
    makes about the runtime system are not vindicated in the current Alice system.

<?php section("example", "example") ?>

  <P>
     Assume that we want to link a component from a site that we do not trust,
     and hence we want to restrict its write access to the file system.
     We can do so by creating a sandbox component manager and evaluating
     the component through it.
  </P>

  <P>
    First, we have to create a suitable <tt>Policy</tt> structure.
    This can be accomplished simply by applying the appropriate functor from
    the <a href="policy.html"><tt>MkPolicy</tt></a> component:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    structure Policy = MkReadOnlyPolicy()</PRE>
    
  <P>
    From this structure we create the sandbox manager:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    structure Safe = Sandbox.MkManager Policy</PRE>

  <P>
    The structure <TT>Safe</TT> will have the full interface of a
    <a href="component-manager.html">component manager</a>. In particular,
    we can use the function
    <TT>Save.<a href="component-manager.html#link">link</a></TT> to
    load the untrusted component:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    open unpack Safe.link(Url.fromString "http:/untrusted.com/Plugin") : SIG</PRE>

  <P>
    To make the example more concrete, let us create a component ourselves:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    val component =
        comp
            import structure TextIO : TEXT_IO from "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
        in
            val run : unit -> string
        with
            fun run() =
            let
               val file = TextIO.openOut "message.txt"
            in
               TextIO.output(file, "Imperative programming rules!\n");
               TextIO.closeOut file;
               "Functional programming is nice."
            end
        end</PRE>

  <P>
    We cannot allow our file system to be spammed with such heretic messages
    behind our backs, so it is a good choice to evaluate the component inside
    the sandbox:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    open unpack Safe.eval(Url.fromString "local", component) : (val run : unit -> string)
    val s = run()</PRE>

  <P>
    Evaluating the call to <TT>run</TT> will fail due to its attempt to
    invoke <TT>TextIO.openOut</TT>, which causes
    a <TT>Security</TT> exception to be raised.
  </P>

  <P class=note>
    <em>Note:</em> The URL we choose here guides how relative imports performed by the component
    are resolved. In this case the component does not have relative
    imports, such that the choice is arbitrary.
  </P>

  <P>
    But hey, maybe we have our noble, pluralistic day, and allow components
    to spread their word as long as they keep it to the <TT>/tmp</TT> directory.
    No problem, we just have to customize the policy accordingly, by defining
    a new rule for the <TT>"writeFile"</TT> capability
    (see the <a href="policy.html#capabilities">list of capabilities</a>):
  </P>

  <PRE class=code>
    fun tempOnly path =
	case OS.Path.fromString (OS.Path.mkCanonical path) of
        | {isAbs=true, arcs="tmp"::_, ...} => Policy.ACCEPT path
        | {isAbs=false, arcs=[name], vol} =>  (*) redirect!
	     Policy.ACCEPT(OS.Path.toString{isAbs=true, arcs=["tmp",name], vol})
	| _ => Policy.REJECT

    do Policy.File.rule("writeFile", tempOnly)</PRE>

  <P>
    This rule does three things: (1) it freely allows opening files for writing
    in the <TT>/tmp</TT> directory, (2) it <EM>redirects</EM> files
    opened without specifying a directory to <TT>/tmp</TT>, and (3) it
    prohibits all other file write access. Note that it is important to make
    the path canonical, in order to avoid exploits with paths like
    <TT>/tmp/../home/user/</TT>.

    After setting this policy rule, our component
    above can be evaluated successfully, and leaves its message in the file
    <TT>/tmp/message.txt</TT>, where it should not cause any harm.
  </P>

  <P>
    What if our policy was violated not during a call, but during evaluation
    of the component itself? For example, consider the following variation:
  </P>
  <PRE class=code>
    val component =
        comp
            import structure TextIO : TEXT_IO from "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
        in
            val run : unit -> string
        with
            val file = TextIO.openOut "/message.txt"
            do TextIO.output(file, "Imperative programming rules!\n")
            do TextIO.closeOut file
            fun run() = "Functional programming is nice."
        end</PRE>

  <P>
    In this case, the <TT>Security</TT> exception would already be raised
    during <TT>Safe.eval</TT>, which evaluates the component body.
    (And the exception will be raised despite our relaxed policy, because the
     component now tries to create the file in the root directory.)
  </P>


<?php subsection("imports", "Controlling imports") ?>

  <P>
    A more radical way to prevent write access is to prevent the system
    components that enable it from being imported <em>at all</em>.
    A rule for the <a href="policy.html#capabilities><TT>"componentLoad"</TT></a>
    capability can be set for this purpose:
  </P>

  <PRE class=code>
    fun noIOCom url =
        case Url.toString url of
        | "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
        | "x-alice:/lib/system/BinIO" => REJECT
        | _ => PASS

    do Policy.Url.rule("componentLoad", noIOCom)</PRE>

  <P>
    This rule implements a form of <em>black-listing</em> of components.
    When it is active, any attempt to import one of the listed components
    will immediately raise a <TT>Security</TT> exception. Note that this
    also applies to imports performed by the Alice ML <TT>import</TT>
    declaration syntax, because that ultimately is mapped to the
    <TT>Component.load</TT> function.
    We only show this for presentational purposes.
    This approach is very restrictive, because it does not only
    disable write access, but actually any kind of I/O
    (at least through these components).

    Another major disadvantage of black-listing is that it is fragile:
    should the sandbox run on a version of Alice that provides additional
    components that enable write access then the policy is no longer safe.
  </P>

  <P>
    A more realistic use of the <TT>"componentLoad"</TT> capability hence
    would be for white-listing external domains from which components may
    be imported:
  </P>

  <PRE class=code>
    fun limitUrl url =
        case (Url.getScheme url, Url.getAuthority url) of
        | (NONE | SOME("file"|"x-alice"), _) => PASS
        | (SOME "http", "www.ps.uni-sb.de"|"www.uni-saarland.de") => PASS
        | _ => REJECT

    do Policy.Url.rule("componentLoad", limitUrl)</PRE>

  <P>
    Instead of outright rejecting some components, a sandbox may also
    redirect the imports to other URLs, which carry safe substitutes, for
    example. This is precisely the approach taken by the
    <a href="policy.html">predefined policy functors</a> to handle
    system components: they redirect imports of these
    components to safe wrappers that check capabilities for individual
    operations.

    For this reason, the action taken for white-listed URLs should be
    <TT>PASS</TT> like above,
    not <TT>ACCEPT</TT>, since accepted URLs still have to be rewritten 
    and delegated to the parent component manager, which is performed by the
    initial rules already set by the functors.
  </P>
