  <P>
    This structure provides support for the implementation of distributed
    applications.  This includes exporting values from and importing values
    into sites, performing remote function application and starting a new
    site.  See the <A href="../distribution.html">distribution overview</A>
    for an introduction to the distribution facilities provided by Alice.
  </P>

  <P>
    Communication between sites is performed by <EM>cloning</EM> data
    structures.  Cloning is defined by <A href="pickle.html">pickling</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
    For more background, see the <a href="../distribution.html">overview of
    distribution</A>.
  </P>

<!--
  <P>
    The current implementation uses HTTP as the transport protocol.
    Accordingly, tickets are URLs using the <TT>http</TT> scheme.

	i.e. the process is <I>not</I> terminated automatically
	(not even if the parent process terminates!). This
	allows concurrent threads to continue running; in particular, it enables
	the remote process to create proxies and return them to the caller who
	can therewith call into the remote process later.
	It also allows a process to migrate to another site, by
	initiating a remote process and then terminating the original one.
	To terminate the remote process, an

	on the remote site is required. If evaluation of the component raises
	an exception, the process is terminated in both cases.</P>

	<P>Note that the <TT>ssh</TT> command must be available on the local

	on the remote site. On Linux, the latter can optionally be achieved by
	setting <TT>ALICE_REMOTE_PATH=<I>&lt;alice-bin-dir&gt;</I></TT> into
	your <TT>~/.ssh/environment</TT> file, if enabled. If that is not

<P>Here is an example of a simple program that creates a component to read the content of a file on a remote site. Note how the mobile component refers to dynamically acquired data, namely the respective file name:</P>

<PRE>
import structure Remote  from "x-alice:/lib/distribution/Remote"
import signature TEXT_IO from "x-alice:/lib/system/TEXT_IO-sig"

structure Main =
struct
   val (hostname, filename) =
	case CommandLine.arguments ()
	 of [s1, s2] => (s1, s2)
	  | _ => (TextIO.output (TextIO.stdErr, "usage: fetch <host> <file>\n");
		  OS.Process.exit OS.Process.failure)

   val component =
       comp
           import structure TextIO : TEXT_IO from "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
       in
           val content : string
       with
           val file = TextIO.openIn filename
           val content = TextIO.inputAll file
           do TextIO.closeIn file
       end

   structure Result =
       unpack Remote.eval (hostname, component) : (val content : string)

   do TextIO.print Result.content
   do OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success
end</PRE>

<!--
<PRE>
import structure Url       from "x-alice:/lib/system/Url"
import structure Remote    from "x-alice:/lib/distribution/Remote"
import signature TEXT_IO   from "x-alice:/lib/system/TEXT_IO-sig"
import signature COMPONENT_MANAGER from "x-alice:/lib/system/COMPONENT_MANAGER-sig"

structure Main =
struct
   val (hostname, filename) =
	case CommandLine.arguments ()
	 of [s1, s2] => (s1, s2)
	  | _ => (TextIO.output (TextIO.stdErr, "usage: fetch <host> <file>\n");
		  OS.Process.exit OS.Process.failure)

   functor Comp (CM : COMPONENT_MANAGER) =
   let
      open CM.Link (val url = Url.fromString "x-alice:/lib/system/TextIO"
		    signature S = (structure TextIO : TEXT_IO))
      val file = TextIO.openIn filename
   in
      (val content = TextIO.inputAll file before TextIO.closeIn file)
   end

   structure Result = Remote.Eval (val host = hostname
				   signature S = (val content : string)
				   structure F = Comp)

   do TextIO.print Result.content
   do OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success
end</PRE>

<?php subsection("examples-chat", "chat room") ?>

<P>A more interesting example is a simple client/server application with bidirectional communication:
a simplistic chat room consisting of a chat server to which multiple clients can connect.</P>

<P>The application consists of two programs: one for the server and one for clients. Both have to agree on the server interface, which we define in a shared component:</P>

<PRE>
(*) SERVER-sig.aml

signature SERVER =
sig
   val register : (string -> unit) -> unit
   val broadcast : string -> unit
end</PRE>

<P>Clients that register with the server will receive all messages sent by other clients, and they can broadcast messages themselves.</P>

<P>Here is the code for the server:</P>

<PRE>
import structure Remote from "x-alice:/lib/distribution/Remote"
import signature SERVER from "SERVER-sig.aml"

val clients = ref nil
fun register client = clients := clients :: !clients
fun broadcast message =
    List.app (fn receive => spawn receive message) (!clients)

structure Server =
struct
   val register = Remote.proxy (Lock.sync (Lock.lock ()) register)
   val broadcast = Remote.proxy broadcast
end

val url = Remote.offer (pack Server : SERVER)
do TextIO.print (url ^ "\n")</PRE>

<P>The server simply keeps a list of registered clients
(represented by their receive functions);
broadcasting iterates over this list and forwards the message to each client.
In order to avoid having to wait for each client in turn
to receive its message, forwarding happens asynchronously,
using a <A href="../futures.html">future</A> created with
<A href="../futures.html#spawn"><TT>spawn</TT></A>.

<P>Moreover, since the client list is stateful,
we have to avoid race conditions when updating it during potentially concurrent
calls to <TT>register</TT> from multiple clients.
The exported <TT>register</TT> function hence synchronises using a fresh
mutex <A href="lock.html">lock</A> (note that we do not need to
synchronise broadcast, since it accesses the reference atomically).</P>

<P>On startup, the server prints a URL for clients to connect. The code for clients is even simpler:</P>

<PRE>
import structure Remote from "x-alice:/lib/distribution/Remote"
import signature SERVER from "SERVER-sig.aml"

val [url, name] = CommandLine.arguments ()

structure Server = unpack Remote.take url : SERVER
do Server.register (Remote.proxy TextIO.print)

fun loop () = case TextIO.inputLine TextIO.stdIn of
              | NONE => OS.Process.exit OS.Process.success
              | SOME line => (Server.broadcast (name ^ ": " ^ line); loop ())
do loop ()</PRE>

<P>It expects a server URL and a user name on the command line, registers with the server, and simply forwards everything typed by the user to the server.
Note that the call to <TT>register</TT> passes a proxy to the local
<TT>print</TT> as argument, so that printing happens on the right site.</P>

<P>This completes the application. Obviously, the implementation is quite simplistic: a user
will see an echo of everything he types. More seriously, there is no error
handling, and disconnecting clients do not notify the server (it will simply go on creating forwarding threads that fail with an <TT>Io</TT> exception).
However, it should be clear how the program could be refined in that
respect.</P>
