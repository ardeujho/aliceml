<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>For particular programming tasks - especially when transferring data between
different processes - it is desirable to relax the strict static rules of ML
and shift some of the type checking to runtime. For this purpose, Alice ML
provides runtime typing through the concept of <EM>packages</EM>.

<P>A package is a value of abstract type <TT>package</TT> that encapsulates
some value, along with its (runtime) type. Accessing the value inside a package
is only possible via an explicit unpack operation, which requires giving the
expected type. A dynamic type check verifies that the actual and the expected
type match.</P>

<P>Instead of just values of the core language, packages may actually contain
arbitrary <A href="modules.html">higher-order modules</A>, paired with their
signature. This way, modules can be passed and stored as first-class values.</P>


<?php section("package", "packages") ?>

<?php subsection("package-pack", "Creating packages") ?>

<P>A package is created using the <TT>pack</TT> expression:</P>

<PRE class=code>
pack <I>strexp</I> : <I>sigexp</I></PRE>

<P>This expression creates a package containing the module denoted by
<TT><I>strexp</I></TT>. The module must (statically) match the given
signature <TT><I>sigexp</I></TT>. This signature will be the <EM>package
signature</EM>.</P>


<?php subsection("package-unpack", "Unpacking packages") ?>

<P>A module can be projected out of a package using the inverse <TT>unpack</TT>
form:</P>

<PRE class=code>
unpack <I>exp</I> : <I>sigexp</I></PRE>

<P>Dynamically, if the package signature of the package returned by expression
<TT><I>exp</I></TT> matches the signature <TT><I>sigexp</I></TT>, this
structure expression evaluates to the module encapsulated in the package.
Otherwise, it raises the exception <A
href="library/package.html"><TT>Package.Mismatch</TT></A>. Since Alice ML
supports <A href="modules.html#local">local modules</A>, the exception may be
handled in the usual way.</P>

<P>Statically, the expression has the signature type denoted by
<TT><I>sigexp</I></TT>, as it can only be evaluated successfully if it
delivers a suitable module. Any use of the unpacked module will be statically
type-safe.</P>


<?php subsection("package-example", "Example") ?>

<P>We can inject the library module <TT>Word8</TT> into a package:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p = pack Word8 : WORD</PRE>

<P>This package may then be passed to some client that may unpack it as
follows:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Word' = unpack p : WORD</PRE>

<P>The package signature matches the expected signature, so that unpacking
succeeds. The client may thus access the <TT>Word'</TT> structure as usual:</P>

<PRE class=code>
print (Word'.toString (Word'.fromInt 255))</PRE>

<P>The package can also be unpacked using a more general signature that contains
fewer items:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure WordFromInt = unpack p : sig type word  val fromInt : int -> word end</PRE>

<P>The full module subtyping rules apply to the unpack type check, so that
unpacking is quite robust with respect to extensions to interfaces of modules
packed elsewhere. In particular, arbitrary items may be added.</P>


<?php subsection("package-sharing", "Sharing") ?>

<P>The package signature of <TT>p</TT> is <TT>WORD</TT>. That signature does not
specify anything about the identity of the contained <TT>word</TT> type.
Consequently, it will be abstract and incompatible with the original type after
unpacking:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Word'.toString (Word8.fromInt 255)   (* static type error! *)</PRE>

<P>In order to make the unpacked structure statically compatible with <TT>Word8</TT>, it has to be unpacked with a more specific signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Word8' = unpack p : WORD where type word = Word8.t</PRE>

<P>In the scope of this declaration, the above expression is legal.</P>

<P>Type constraints can also be used to specify sharing between different
packages:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun g(p1, p2) =
    let
	signature S  = sig type t  val x : t  val f : t -> int end
	structure X1 = unpack p1 : S
	structure X2 = unpack p2 : S where type t = X1.t
    in
	X2.f X1.x
    end</PRE>

<P>In this example, the types <TT>t</TT> in both packages are unknown. However,
they might be known to be equal. The second <TT>unpack</TT> expression enforces
this requirement dynamically, by specifying the necessary type equivalence.</P>

<P>Sometimes it is desirable to make a package fully opaque. The derived syntax</P>

<PRE class=code>
pack <I>strexp</I> :> <I>sigexp</I></PRE>

<P>enables this. When <TT>Word8</TT> is packed like</P>

<PRE class=code>
val p = pack Word8 :> WORD</PRE>

<P>The attempt to unpack it transparently,</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Word8' = unpack p : WORD where type word = Word8.t</PRE>

<P>will fail.</P>


<?php section("firstclass", "first-class modules") ?>

<P>The main application for first-class modules in the form of packages is in
combination with <A href="pickling.html">pickling</A>, where they allow to make
implementations of abstract types or whole programs persistent, and with <A
href="distribution.html">distributed programming</A>, where they enable
transfer of program components to remote locations.</A>

<P>Packages can also be used for encoding more traditional idioms requiring
first-class modules. For example, the implementation of a map module may be
chosen dependent on some condition, assuming the alternative implementations
satisfy a common signature:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Map = unpack (if maxElems < 100
                        then pack BinTreeMap : MAP)
			else pack HashTableMap : MAP) : MAP</PRE>

<!--
<P>Another application is to use structures for object-oriented style
programming. Consider there is a signature</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature SHAPE =
sig
    type t
    type vec = int * int
    val self : t
    val pos :  t -> vec
    val move : t * vec -> unit
end</PRE>

<P>and several functors</P>

<PRE class=code>
functor Rect    (val h : int val w : int) : sig include SHAPE (* ... *) end
functor Circle  (val r : int)             : sig include SHAPE (* ... *) end
functor Polygon (val ps : vec list)       : sig include SHAPE (* ... *) end</PRE>

<P>These functors can be thought of as classes, while the structures they
return are objects of the corresponding classes. By packing object structures
they can be stored in a list, for example:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val shapes = [pack Rect : SHAPE, pack Circle : SHAPE, pack Polygon : SHAPE]</PRE>

<P>It is possible to iterate over <TT>l</TT> without knowing the concrete object
types:</P>

<PRE class=code>
List.app (fn p => let structure S = unpack p : SHAPE
                  in S.move (S.self, (~4,~2))) shapes</PRE>
-->


<?php section("dynamic", "dynamic typing") ?>

<P>Packages rely on dynamic typing, thus types (and signatures) have a dynamic
semantics. An important property of the semantics is that it does not
undermine any properties of the static type system. In particular, all
abstraction guarantees carry over from static to dynamic typing: no type
abstraction can be broken by use of the dynamic typing implied by packages. For
example, the following declarations will not evaluate successfully:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature S      = sig    type t       val x : t end
structure X :> S = struct type t = int val x = 9 end

val p = pack X : S

structure X' = unpack p : S where type t = int</PRE>

<P>The unpacking as shown here will always fail, since the type <TT>X.t</TT> is
dynamically abstract. The only possible type that <TT>t</TT> can be specified
equal to is the abstract type itself:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure X' = unpack p : S where type t = X.t</PRE>

<P>The following also works (see <A
href="#package-sharing">sharing</A>):</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure X1 = unpack p : S
structure X2 = unpack p : S where type t = X1.t</PRE>

<P>The dynamic semantics of types is as follows:</P>

<UL>

<LI>All <EM>explicitly declared</EM> types and signatures have a dynamic
representation. In particular, structures carry the contained type
fields (and <A href="modules.html#sigmembers">signature fields</A>). This implies
that types are passed to and returned from functors.</LI>

<LI>Evaluation of a <EM>generative</EM> type declaration (e.g.
<A href="types.html#exttype"><TT>exttype</TT></A>) creates a fresh type name. Generated names are globally
unique, so that they are valid across process boundaries and may be stored in
<A href="pickling.html">pickles</A>.</LI>

<LI><EM>Structure sealing</EM> is generative as well: a structure expression of
the form <TT><I>strexp</I> :> <I>sigexp</I></TT> creates a new structure, in
which all type fields (and signature fields) from <TT><I>strexp</I></TT> are
replaced according to <TT><I>sigexp</I></TT>. For every abstract type (and <A
href="modules.html#sigmembers-abstract">abstract signature</A>) contained in
<TT><I>sigexp</I></TT>, a fresh name is generated and substituted. Nested
modules are sealed recursively.</LI>

<LI>For functors, sealing creates a new functor that seals its result module
upon application.</LI>

<LI>Packages contain the dynamic representation of their signature.</LI>

<LI>Unpacking performs a dynamic signature match between the package signature
and the given target signature. In the case of success, it returns the packaged
module unchanged, otherwise raises <A
href="library/package.html"><TT>Package.Mismatch</TT></A>.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Note that polymorphic functions are still parametric and thus can be
interpreted in a type erasure semantics. To pass type information, a function
has to be lifted to the functor level. Due to <A
href="modules.html#local">local modules</A> this is possible in most cases.</P>

<!--
<P>Packing performs sealing to ensure consistency between the package signature
and dynamic types contained in the packaged module. If no sealing took place,
anomalies would be possible, like successful evaluation of the following
program:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature S = sig    type t       val x : t end
structure X = struct type t = int val x = 9 end

val p1 = pack X :> S
structure X1 = unpack p1 : S

val p2 = pack X1 :> (S where type t = X1.t)
structure X2 = unpack p2 : (S where type t = int)</PRE>

<P>Here, <TT>X</TT> has a transparent type <TT>t</TT> <TT>=</TT> <TT>int</TT>,
but the package signature makes it abstract. Consequently, unpacking it under
the constraint <TT>t</TT> <TT>=</TT> <TT>int</TT> would be unsuccessful.
However, if packing would not perform sealing, <TT>X1.t</TT> indeed was
<TT>int</TT> dynamically, so that an additional packing/unpacking step sufficed
to reveal the implementation type. A package could leak information that was
not appearent from its signature.</P>

<P>On the other hand, unpacking is transparent. The following program evaluates
successfully:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature S = sig    type t       val x : t end
structure X = struct type t = int val x = 9 end

val p1 = pack X :> (S where type t = int)
structure X1 = unpack p1 : S

val p2 = pack X1 :> (S where type t = X1.t)
structure X2 = unpack p2 : S where type t = int</PRE>

<P>In this case, the second <TT>pack</TT> expression makes the signature of
<TT>p2</TT> transparent relative to <TT>p1</TT>, without knowing the actual
type <TT>t</TT> contained in <TT>p1</TT>. Note that it is not possible to
specify <TT>t</TT> <TT>=</TT> <TT>int</TT> at this point, because statically,
<TT>X1.t</TT> is abstract since it has been unpacked abstractly.</P>

<P>Transparent semantics of unpacking are necessary to allow expressing <A
href="#package-sharing">sharing</A>.</P>
-->

<!--
<?php subsection("dynamic-analysis", "Dynamic type analysis") ?>

<P>Packages can be abused to investigate types dynamically. This is particularly
interesting for functor arguments:</P>

<PRE class=code>
functor GetMonoVector(type t) =
    let
	val t = pack (type t = t) :> (type t = t)
	val p = let structure _ = unpack t : (type t = char) in
		    pack CharVector : (MONO_VECTOR where type elem = char) end
		handle Package.Mismatch _ =>
		let structure _ = unpack t : (type t = Word8.t) in
		    pack Word8Vector : (MONO_VECTOR where type elem = Word8.t) end
		handle Package.Mismatch _ =>
		    pack (type elem = t
			  open Vector
			  type vector = elem vector
			  type t = vector
			  fun contains eq xs y = exists (fn x => x = y) xs
			  fun notContains eq xs = not o contains eq xs)
		       : MONO_VECTOR
    in
	unpack p : MONO_VECTOR where type elem = t
    end</PRE>
-->

<!--
<?php section("valpackage", "value packages") ?>

<P>Often it is not necessary to package whole modules. For convenience, the <A
href="library/package.html"><TT>Package</TT></A> module thus provides functors
that allow packaging of simple core values. Essentially, this provides a type
<EM>dynamic</EM>, as available in a few other statically-typed languages.</P>
