<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>A <EM>pickle</EM> is a serialized and closed representation of a value,
stored in a file, for instance. Pickles can be used to exchange arbitrary data structures
between processes. Pickles may contain higher-order values (i.e., functions)
as well as complete modules (e.g., implementations of abstract types).
Pickling is type-safe: a pickle is in fact a serialized representation
of a <A href="packages.html">package</A>, a pair of a value and its type.
Types are checked at unpickling time.</P>


<?php section("semantics", "semantics") ?>

<P>When a value is pickled, this comprehends the transitive closure of all
objects referenced by that value. We distinguish three sorts of values:</P>

<UL>
<LI> <I>Functional</I>
     values do not contain any mutable objects.  Functional values can
     be pickled. Unpickling a functional value results in an object
     indistinguishable from the original object. </LI>

<LI> <I>Stateful</I>
     values do contain mutable objects like references or arrays.  Stateful
     values can also be pickled. In contrast to functional values, unpickling
     a stateful value always returns a fresh copy of state the object was
     in at pickling time.  Sharing between stateful objects within a single
     pickle is maintained. </LI>

<LI> <I>Sited</I>
     values contain <EM>resources</EM>.  A resource is an object that cannot be
     meaningfully interpreted outside of the process it was created in,
     or that represents a security-relevant capability.
     Sited values may not be pickled: any attempt to pickle a sited value
     results in a runtime exception. This is necessary to enable
     security and <A href="components.html#managers">sandboxing</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Special care must be taken to avoid runtime errors from attempts to
pickle sited values.  Resources may be operating system handles (for example,
open files) or computational resources (for example, first-class threads).
Higher-order values may be sited without this being visible in their
type, for instance, when a function closure references a sited object.
Moreover, all functions that create resources are themselves sited.</P>

<P><A href="futures.html">Futures</A> are never pickled. Instead, pickling
<A href="futures.html#request">requests</A> all futures in the value to be
pickled.</P>


<?php section("export", "persistent modules") ?>

<P>Pickling is available through the structure <A
href="library/pickle.html"><TT>Pickle</TT></A>. The canonical operation to
create a pickle is the operation</P>

<PRE class=code>
save : string * package -> unit</PRE>

<P>For example, the <TT>Int</TT> module can be exported as a pickle as
follows:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Pickle.save("Int." ^ Pickle.extension, pack Int : INTEGER)</PRE>

<P>The package will be serialized to a file with the specified name. The string
<TT>Pickle.extension</TT> gives the file extension idiomatically used for
pickles on the current platform. If the module contained references to any
sited objects, an <A href="library/io.html"><TT>IO.Io</TT></A> exception
would be raised, with <TT>Sited</TT> indicating the cause of the
failure (<TT>Int</TT> is not sited, however).</P>

<P>The inverse operation is unpickling, available through the operation</P>

<PRE class=code>
load : string -> package</PRE>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure Int' = unpack Pickle.load("Int." ^ Pickle.extension) : INTEGER</PRE>

<P>If unpickling is successful, <TT>Int'</TT> will be accessible as a structure
with signature <TT>INTEGER</TT>. Loading of a pickle may fail with an
<A href="library/io.html"><TT>IO.Io</TT></A> exception.</P>


<?php subsection("export-sharing", "sharing") ?>

<P>Pickled modules can contain abstract types. Sometimes it is
necessary to express sharing between abstract types of different
pickles. The way to deal with this is using appropriate type constraints upon
unpacking the loaded package. For example, consider an abstract datatype</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature T =
sig
    type t
    val mk : int -> t
    val f : t -> int
end</PRE>

<P>that is stored in a pickle <TT>p1</TT>. Another pickle <TT>p2</TT> contains
a value of that type. Both can be loaded and used together:</P>

<PRE class=code>
structure T = unpack p1 : T
structure V = unpack p2 : (val x : T.t)

val n = T.f V.x
</PRE>

<P>See also the section on <A
href="packages.html#package-sharing">sharing across packages</A>.</P>


<?php section("components", "pickles and components") ?>

<P>Pickles are closely related to <A href="components.html">components</A>.
In fact, a pickle is the special case of an <A
href="components.html#evaluated">evaluated component</A>, residing in a file.
Pickles can thus be imported through <A href="components.html#source">import
announcements</A>.</P>

<P>The load operations for pickles can access arbitrary components. The file
name argument is interpreted as an URI. If the file at the designated location
does not contain a plain pickle, the component will be linked and evaluated by
the current component manager and its export is returned. This may cause
arbitrary side effects. In particular, it may trigger the loading of
additional, transitively imported components, if their exports are
required.</P>

<P>Note that evaluation of components causes the creation of new <A
href="packages.html#dynamic">generative types</A>. Thus, if a non-pickle
component is loaded twice, any generative types contained in its export will
be incompatible between both instances. The same holds for exceptions.</P>
