<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>
  <P>The current Alice system is based on the
    <A href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">Mozart Programming System</A>
    and supports interoperability between Oz and Alice.</P>
  <P>The Alice compiler translates components into pickled Oz functors.
    It is possible to mix Oz and Alice code on a per-component basis.
    This document explains:</P>

  <P>Values of basic types are mapped to corresponding Oz basic types.
    To support <TT>word</TT> operations, Mozart has been extended by a
    corresponding basic type.</P>

  <?php subsection("records", "Tuples and records") ?>

    all labels containing a letter to the corresponding atom feature.</P>

  <?php subsection("procedures", "Procedures") ?>
  <P>Conceptually, all Alice functions are unary.  The typical idiom is
    to pass multiple arguments as a tuple of arguments.  This case is
    treated specially by the Alice compiler.</P>
  <CENTER>
    <TABLE class=dyptic>
      <TR><TH>Alice Procedure<TH>Oz Representation
      <TR>
	<TD>Function in which every pattern is either an explicit
	  <I>n</I>-tuple or a wildcard
	<TD><I>n</I>+1-ary procedure, having <I>n</I> input arguments
	  and one output argument
      <TR><TD>Any other function<TD>Binary procedure
    </TABLE>
  </CENTER>
  <P>When applying functions in Alice, a <EM><A name="ccc">calling convention
    conversion</A></EM> is performed:  If a single-argument function is
    applied to several arguments (that is, a manifest tuple), these arguments
    are tupled to form a single argument.  Conversely, when a multiple-argument
    function (that is, a function expecting a manifest tuple) is applied to a
    single argument, it is deconstructed as a tuple.</P>

  <DIV class=note>
    <P>Note that care must be taken when calling a first-class function
      defined in Alice from an Oz procedure: calling procedures from
      Oz does not perform calling convention conversion automatically.
      Therefore, the user must write code to do this explicitly using
      the <TT>Procedure.arity</TT> and <TT>Procedure.apply</TT> builtins.
      For instance, if F is to be called with three arguments, but may
      have been defined in Alice:</P>
    <PRE>
      X = case {Procedure.arity F}
	  of 4 then {F A B C}   % call with three arguments directly
	  [] 2 then {F A#B#C}   % call with one (constructed) argument
	  end</PRE>
    <P>Note that a three-argument Alice function is a four-argument Oz
      procedure (because of the return value), and that a one-argument
      Alice function is a two-argument Oz procedure.</P>
  </DIV>

  <?php subsection("constructors", "Constructors") ?>
  <P>With a few exceptions simplifying interoperability, constructors of
    closed datatypes are mapped to atoms and constructors of extensible
    datatypes are mapped to names.</P>

  <?php subsection("convals", "Constructed values") ?>
  <P>Conceptually, all Alice constructors are unary.  For interoperability,
    constructors syntactically declared taking a record as argument are
    treated as <A href="incompatibilities.html#conarity"><I>n</I>-ary
    constructors</A>.</P>

  <P>the Alice expression <TT>C1 (1, 2)</TT> evaluates to the Oz value

    However, assuming the declaration</P>
  <PRE>        datatype 'a t2 = C2 of 'a</PRE>
  <P>the Alice expression <TT>C2 (1, 2)</TT> evaluates to the Oz value

  <?php subsection("components", "Components") ?>
  <P>Alice components are translated into Oz functors:</P>
  <CENTER>
    <TABLE class=dyptic>
      <TR><TH>Alice Component<TH>Oz Representation
      <TR><TD>Compiled component<TD>Pickled functor
    </TABLE>
  </CENTER>
  <P>The export of the generated functor is the record corresponding
    to the component considered as a single structure.</P>

  <?php subsection("exceptions", "Exceptions") ?>
  <P>Alice exceptions are wrapped into <TT>alice(...)</TT> and raised
    as Oz error exceptions.</P>

<?php section("ozfromalice", "Oz from Alice") ?>
  <P>Alice compiled components are annotated with signatures denoting
    the expected signatures of the component it imports and the actual signature
    of the structure it computes.  Compatibility of actual and expected
    signatures is checked at link-time to guarantee type safety.
    The actual export signature is also loaded at compile time to
    perform binding analysis and type-checking.</P>
  <P>For this reason, export signatures must first be provided for Oz
    functors before they can be imported into Alice components.  This
    will be shown by an example.</P>
  <P>Assume the following Oz functor is stored at URL
    <TT>F.ozf</TT>:</P>
  <PRE>
        functor
        import
           System(show)
        export
           show: Show
        define
           fun {Show X} {System.show X} unit end
        end</PRE>
  <P>To import this component into Alice, we would write a signature
    file <TT>F.asig</TT> containing:</P>
  <PRE>
        signature F_COMPONENT =
            sig
                val show: 'a -> unit
            end</PRE>
  <P>We can now import the component into Alice using an import announcement
    of the form</P>
  <PRE>        import val show from "F"</PRE>
  <P>This will read the signature from <TT>F.asig</TT>, and consider the
    structure exported from <TT>F.ozf</TT> to conform to this signature.
    (Note that the name of the signature is ignored.)  If the signature
    does not truthfully describe the Oz component, run-time errors will
    occur.</P>

<?php section("alicefromoz", "Alice from Oz") ?>
  <P>Since Oz does not type-check its imports at link-time, Alice components
    can be directly imported into Oz functors without conversion.</P>
  <P>For example, assume the following Alice component is available at
    URL <TT>Example.ozf</TT>:</P>
  <PRE>
        structure Example =
            struct
                fun count f xs =
                    List.foldr (fn (x, n) =>
                                if f x then n + 1 else n) 0 xs
            end</PRE>
  <P>An Oz functor could now import it as follows:</P>
  <PRE>
        functor
        import
            System(show)
            ExampleComponent('Example$': Example) at 'Example.ozf'
        define
            {System.show
             {{Example.count fun {$ X} X == 0 end} [1 0 2 0]}}
        end</PRE>
