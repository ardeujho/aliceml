evaluates it.</P>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> Windows does not properly allow a single program to support both text mode <I>and</I> GUI mode. Thus, <TT>alicerun</TT> will always open a console window (if not started from a console shell), even if it does not perform any I/O on standard channels. As an alternative, we hence provide the <TT>alicerunwin</TT> command on Windows:</P>

be a Mozart component (<A
