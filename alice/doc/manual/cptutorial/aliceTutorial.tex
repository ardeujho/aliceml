\section{Introduction}
This document is a first introduction to \emph{Constraint Programming}
in Alice.

\emph{Constraint Progamming} is a problem-solving technique for
\emph{combinatorial problems} that works by incorporating constraints
into a \emph{programming environment} (after \cite{3} \emph{Principles
  of Constraint Programming.} by \emph{Krysztof R. Apt}).

Combinatorial problems question about properties (constraints) of a
class of \emph{combinatorial structures} which are characterized in
terms of a finite set of variables and a finite value for each
variable.

Finally, the constraint programming features of Alice that are build
upon the \emph{Gecode}~\cite{12} constraint library realize the
requirements of Apt's definition.

First, this document covers combinatorial problems that can be
stated with variables ranging over finite domains of
integers. Later, those problems are expanded by allowing variables to
range over finite sets of integers.
Problems in this class range from puzzles to real world applications as 
diverse as scheduling, ware house allocation, configuration and placement.

The two basic techniques of constraint programming are
\emph{constraint propagation} and \emph{branching}. Constraint
propagation is an efficient inference mechanism obtained with
concurrent propagators accumulating information in a \emph{constraint
  store}.  Branching splits a problem into complementary cases once
constraint propagation cannot advance further, i.e. it reaches a
fixpoint.  By iterating propagation and branching, propagation will
eventually determine the solutions of a problem.

Branching can easily lead to an exponential growth of the number of
subproblems to be considered. Fortunately, this potential
combinatorial explosion can often be contained by combining strong
propagation mechanisms with problem specific heuristics for selecting
branching steps.

The following puzzles give a first idea of the combinatorial problems
that will be solved in this document:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\textbf{Money}

The Send More Money Problem consists in finding distinct 
digits for the letters 
D, E, M, N, O, R, S, Y such that S and M are different 
from zero (no leading zeros) and 
the equation
    $ SEND + MORE = MONEY $
is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem is 
9567 + 1085 = 10652.

\item
\textbf{Safe}

The code of Professor Smart's safe is a sequence of 9 
distinct nonzero digits 
$ C_1,\ldots,C_9 $ such that the following equations 
and inequations are satisfied:\\
     $ C_4 - C_6 = C_7 \\ 
     C_1 * C_2 * C_3 = C_8 + C_9 \\ 
     C_2 + C_3 + C_6 < C_8 \\ 
     C_9 < C_8 \\ 
     C_1 \neq 1,\ldots, C_9 \neq 9 $

Can you determine the code?

\item
\textbf{Coloring}

Given a map showing the West European countries Netherlands, 
Belgium, France, Spain, 
Portugal, Germany, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy, 
find a coloring such 
that neighboring countries have different color and a minimal 
number of colors is used.

\item

\textbf{Grocery}

A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier 
charges \$ 7.11, the kid 
pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, 
and says

`` Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; 
I'll try again; 
Hah, with adding them the price still comes to \$ 7.11 .''

What were the prices of the four items?

\item
\textbf{Queens}

Place 8 queens on a chess board such that no two queens attack 
each other.
\end{itemize}

The problems have in common that they can be stated with variables 
that are a priori 
constrained to finite sets of nonnegative integers. Consequently, 
the problems could be 
solved by simply checking all possible combinations of the values 
of the variables. This naive 
generate and test method is however infeasible for most realistic 
problems since there are just 
too many possible combinations.


\subsection{More Information}

While this tutorial tries to be as self-contained as possible for 
constraint programming in Alice, 
it is expected that the reader has already a working knowledge of
functional Alice programming. Alice is a functional programming
language based on \textcolor{blue}{Standard ML}, extended with rich
support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming.
As an introduction for functional programming in Alice we suggest the 
\cite{4} ``\htmladdnormallink
{\textcolor{blue}{Short Tour to Alice}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/tour.html}
`` by \emph{Andreas Rossberg}.

\subsection{The Examples}

The tutorial features a large number of examples. To ease the 
understanding the examples should 
be tried in the Alice Programming Environment. The Alice 
programs can be downloaded from the 
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{sample

\section{Propagate and Branch}
\label{sec 2}
This section presents the architecture of constraint-based problem 
solving at the
\textbf{concrete instance of finite domain problems}. 
I will often refer to the 
underlying solution method with 
the slogan ``propagate and branch''. The slogan recalls the 
two inference rules of the method, 
constraint propagation and branching.

\subsection{Finite Domains and Constraints}
A \emph{finite domain} is a finite set of integers. 
A constraint is a formula of predicate logic. 
Here are typical examples of 
constraints occurring with finite domain problems:
\begin{quote}
          $ X=67 \hspace{5mm} X\in\dom{0}{9} \hspace{5mm} X=Y $\\ 
          $ X^2-Y^2=Z^2  \hspace{5mm} X+Y+Z<U \hspace{5mm} X+Y\neq5\cdot Z $ \\ 
          $ X_1,\ldots,X_9 $ \hspace{2mm} are pairwise distinct \\
\end{quote}

A \emph{domain constraint} (also called basic constraint) takes the form
$ x \in D $, where D is a finite domain.

A \emph{finite domain problem} is a finite set P of quantifier-free 
constraints such that P 
contains a domain constraint for every variable occurring in a 
constraint of P. A variable 
assignment is a function mapping variables to integers.

A \emph{solution} of a finite domain problem P is a variable 
assignment that satisfies every 
constraint in P.

Notice that a finite domain problem has at most finitely 
many solutions, provided we consider
only variables that occur in the problem (since the problem 
contains a finite domain constraint 
for every variable occurring in it).  

\subsection{Constraint Propagation}
\label{section2-2}
Constraint propagation is an inference rule for finite domain 
problems that narrows the domains 
of variables. For instance, given the inequation
\begin{quote}
$ X < Y $
\end{quote}
and the basic constraints
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{23}{100} $
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
$ Y \in \dom{1}{33} $
\end{quote}
constraint propagation can narrow the domains of X and Y to
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{23}{32} $
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}
$ Y \in \dom{24}{33} $
\end{quote}

\subsection{Spaces, Propagators, and Constraint Stores}
The computational architecture for constraint propagation is 
called a \emph{space}\label{space} and consists 
of a number of propagators connected to a constraint store:

\begin{figure}[htpb]

\centerline{
\includegraphics*[scale=0.4]{figs/cp_2_new.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{A computational architecture for Constraint Propagation}}
\label{figure1}
\end{figure}

The \emph{constraint store} stores a conjunction of basic 
constraints up to logical equivalence. 
An example for such a conjunction is
\begin{quote}
$  X \in \dom{0}{5}  \hspace{2mm}\wedge{} \hspace{2mm}Y=8 \hspace{2mm} 
\wedge{}\hspace{2mm} Z \in \dom{13}{23}.$
\end{quote}
The \emph{propagators} impose \emph{nonbasic} constraints, 
for instance,
\begin{quote}
$ X < Y $ , $ X = Y $ or $ X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2 $.
\end{quote}

A propagator for a constraint C is a computational 
agent that tries to narrow 
the domains of the variables occurring in C.

Two propagators that share a variable X can communicate with 
each other through the constraint store. 
To see an example for communicating propagators, suppose we 
have two propagators imposing the constraints
\begin{quote}
$ X+Y=9 \hspace{5mm} 2 \cdot X + 4\cdot Y = 24 $
\end{quote}
over a constraint store containing the following information 
about X and Y:
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{0}{9} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{0}{9} $
\end{quote}

As is, the first propagator cannot do anything. The second 
propagator, however, can narrow the domains 
of both X and Y:
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{0}{8} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{2}{6} $
\end{quote}
Now the first propagator can narrow the domain of X:
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{3}{7} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{2}{6} $
\end{quote}
Now the second propagator can narrow the domains of both X and Y:
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{4}{6} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{3}{4} $
\end{quote}
This once more activates the first propagator, which narrows 
the domain of X:
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{5}{6} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{3}{4} $
\end{quote}
Now the second propagator gets active once more and determines 
the values of X and Y:
\begin{quote}
$ X=6  \hspace{4mm} Y=3 $
\end{quote}

Given a constraint store storing a constraint S and a propagator 
imposing a constraint P, 
the propagator can tell to the constraint store a basic 
constraint B if the conjunction $ S \wedge{} P$ 
entails B and B adds new and consistent information to the 
store. To \emph{tell} a constraint B to a 
constraint store storing the constraint S means to update 
the store so that it holds the 
conjunction $ S \wedge{} B$.

The \emph{operational semantics} of a propagator determines 
whether the propagator can tell the store 
a basic constraint or not. The operational semantics of a 
propagator must of course respect 
the \emph{declarative semantics} of the propagator, which is 
given by the constraint the propagator imposes.

We require that the constraint store be always \emph{consistent}; 
that is, there must always be at least 
one variable assignment that satisfies all constraints in the 
constraint store.

We say that the constraint store \emph{determines} a variable 
x if the constraint store knows the value of x, 
that is, if there exists an integer n such that the constraint 
store entails x = n.

We say that a propagator is \emph{inconsistent} if there is 
no variable assignment that satisfies 
both the constraint store and the constraint imposed by the 
propagator 
(e.g., $ X + Y = 6 $ over $ X \in \dom{3}{9} $ and $ Y \in \dom{4}{9} $). 
We say that a propagator is \emph{failed} if its 
operational semantics realizes that it is inconsistent.

We say that a propagator is \emph{entailed} if every variable 
assignment that satisfies the constraint 
store also satisfies the constraint imposed by the propagator 
(e.g., $ X < Y $ over $ X \in \dom{3}{5} $ and $ Y \in \dom{6}{9} $). 
As soon as the operational semantics of a 
propagator realizes that the propagator is entailed, the 
propagator ceases to exist.

We require that the operational semantics of a propagator 
detects inconsistency and entailment at the 
latest when the store determines all variables of the 
propagator.

We say that a space is \emph{failed} if one of its propagators 
is failed. 

We say that a space is \emph{solved} if all variables occuring 
in it are determined.

When a space is created, its propagators start to tell basic 
constraints to the constraint store. 
This propagation activity continues until a fixpoint is reached. 
An important property of constraint 
propagation as we consider it here is the fact that the order 
in which the propagators tell information 
to the store does not matter. When we start a space repeatedly 
from the same state, it will either 
always fail or always arrive at the same constraint store 
(up to logical equivalence).

A variable assignment is called a \emph{solution} of a space 
if it satisfies the constraints in the 
constraint store and all constraints imposed by the propagators. 
The solutions of a space stay invariant 
under constraint propagation and deletion of entailed propagators.

\subsection{Interval and Domain Propagation}
There are two established schemes for the operational semantics 
of a propagator. \emph{Domain propagation}
narrows the domains of the variables as much as possible, i.e. all
values that are not consistent with the constraint are removed; 
\emph{interval propagation} only narrows the 
bounds of a domain.

Consider a propagator for the constraint
\begin{quote}
$  2\cdot X = Y $
\end{quote}
over a constraint store
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{1}{10} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{1}{7} $
\end{quote}
Under domain propagation, the propagator can narrow the 
domains to
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{1}{3} \hspace{4mm}  Y \in \{2,4,6\}$
\end{quote}
Under interval propagation, the propagator can narrow 
only the domain bounds, which yields
\begin{quote}
$ X \in \dom{1}{3} \hspace{4mm}  Y \in \dom{2}{6}$
\end{quote}

In practice, interval propagation is usually preferable over domain
propagation because of its lower computational costs. But domain
propagation often leads to considerably smaller search trees (figure
\ref{figure2}).  In Alice, some propagators have an additional
argument \emph{conlevel}. There you can specify the propagators
consistency level.

\subsection{Incompleteness of Propagation}
Constraint propagation is not a complete solution method. 
It may happen that a space has a unique 
solution and that constraint propagation does not find it. 
It may also happen that a space has no 
solution and that constraint propagation does not lead to 
a failed propagator.

A straightforward example for the second case consists of 
three propagators for
\begin{quote}
 $ X \neq Y \hspace{4mm} X \neq Z \hspace{4mm} Y \neq Z $
\end{quote}
and a constraint store
\begin{quote}
    $ X \in \sdom{0}{1} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{0}{1} \hspace{4mm} Z \in \sdom{0}{1}.$
\end{quote}
This space has no solution. Nevertheless, none of the propagators is
inconsistent or can tell something to the constraint store.

To see an example for the case where a unique solution is not found by
constraint propagation, suppose we have interval propagators for the
constraints
\begin{quote}
$ 3 \cdot X + 3 \cdot Y = 5 \cdot Z \hspace{4mm} X - Y = Z 
\hspace{4mm} X + Y = Z + 2 $
\end{quote}
and a constraint store
\begin{quote}
   $ X \in \dom{4}{10} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{1}{7} \hspace{4mm} Z 
\in \dom{3}{9}$
\end{quote}
This space has the unique solution X = 4, Y = 1, Z = 3. 
Nevertheless, none of the propagators can 
narrow a variable domain.

If we narrow the domains to
\begin{quote}
   $ X \in \dom{5}{10} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{1}{6} \hspace{4mm} Z \in \dom{4}{9}$
\end{quote}
the space becomes unsatisfiable. Still, none of the above 
propagators is inconsistent or can 
narrow a variable domain. 

\subsection{Branching and Search Trees}
To solve a finite domain problem P, we can always choose 
a constraint C and solve both 
$ P\cup\{C\}$ and $ P\cup\{\neg C\}$. We say that we 
have \emph{branched} P with C.

We can apply the idea to spaces. Suppose S is a space 
in which at least one variable is not determined. 
Then we can choose a constraint C and \emph{branch} 
S with C. Branching yields two spaces, one 
obtained by adding a propagator for C, and one obtained 
by adding a propagator for $\neg C$.

The combination of constraint propagation and branching 
yields a complete solution method 
for finite domain problems. Given a problem, we set up a 
space whose store contains the basic 
constraints and whose propagators impose the nonbasic 
constraints of the problem. Then we run 
the propagators until they reached a fxpoint. If all 
variables are determined, we are done. 
Otherwise, we choose a not yet determined variable x 
and an integer n such that x = n is consistent 
with the constraint store and branch the space 
with the constraint x = n. Since we can tell both 
x = n and $ x \neq n $ to the constraint store (the store 
already knows a domain for x), chances are 
that constraint propagation can restart in both spaces.

By proceeding this way we obtain a \emph{search tree} as
shown in figure \ref{figure2}. Each node of the tree 
corresponds to a space. Each leaf of the tree corresponds 
to a space that is either solved or failed. 
The search tree is always finite since there are only 
finitely many variables all a priori constrained 
to finite domains.

\begin{figure}[htpb]

\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{figs/search-tree.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{A search tree}. Diamonds represent solved spaces 
and boxes represent failed spaces.}
\label{figure2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{An Example}
To see the outlined propagate and branch method at a 
concrete example, consider the problem
 specified by the following constraints:
\begin{quote}
$ X \neq 7 \hspace{4mm} Z \neq 2 \hspace{4mm} X-Z = 3\cdot Y $ \\
$ X \in \dom{1}{8} \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{1}{10} \hspace{4mm} Z \in \dom{1}{10} $
\end{quote}
To solve the problem, we start with a space whose store 
constrains the variables X, Y, and Z to 
the given domains. We also create three propagators 
imposing the constraints $ X \neq 7, Z \neq 2$, and 
$ X - Z = 3 \cdot Y$ . We assume that the propagator 
for $ X - Z = 3\cdot Y$ realizes interval propagation, 
and that the propagators for the disequations $ X \neq 7 $ 
and $ Z \neq 2 $ realize domain propagation.

The propagators for the disequations immediately write 
all their information into the store and 
disappear. The store then knows the domains
\begin{quote}
    $ X \in [\dom{1}{6} ; 8] \hspace{4mm} Y \in \dom{1}{10} 
\hspace{4mm} Z \in [1 ; \dom{3}{10}]$
\end{quote}
where $ [1 ; \dom{3}{10}]$ denotes the finite domain 
$ \{1\}\cup\{3,\ldots,10\}$. The interval propagator 
for $ X-Z = 3\cdot Y $ can now further narrow the domains to
\begin{quote}
    $ X\in[\dom{4}{6} ; 8] \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{1}{2} 
\hspace{4mm} Z\in[1 ; \dom{3}{5}].$
\end{quote}
Now propagation has reached a fixpoint. Thus, we continue 
with a first branching 
step. We choose to branch with the constraint X = 4. 
Figure \ref{figure3} shows the resulting search tree. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]

\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.7]{figs/search-tree-exmpl.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{A search tree containing 3 choice nodes, 
1 failure node, and 3 solution nodes.}}
\label{figure3}
\end{figure}





The space obtained by adding a propagator for X = 4 can be 
solved by propagation and yields the solution
\begin{quote}
    $ X=4  \hspace{4mm} Y=1  \hspace{4mm} Z=1$
\end{quote}
The space obtained by adding a propagator for $ X\neq 4 $ 
reaches a fixpoint immediately after this propagator 
has written its information into the constraint store, 
which then looks as follows:
\begin{quote}
    $ X \in [\dom{5}{6} ; 8]  \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{1}{2}  
\hspace{4mm} Z \in [1 \; \dom{3}{5}]$
\end{quote}
This time we branch with respect to the constraint X = 5.

The space obtained by adding a propagator for X = 5 fails 
since $ X-Z= 3\cdot Y $ is inconsistent with 
the store obtained by adding X = 5.

The space obtained by adding a propagator for $ X \neq 5$ 
reaches a fixpoint immediately after this propagator 
has written its information into the constraint store, 
which then looks as follows:
\begin{quote}
    $ X \in [6 \; 8]  \hspace{4mm} Y \in \sdom{1}{2}  
\hspace{4mm} Z \in [1 \; \dom{3}{5}]$
\end{quote}
Now we branch with respect to the constraint X = 6.

The space obtained by adding a propagator for X = 6 can be 
solved by propagation and yields the solution
\begin{quote}
    $ X = 6  \hspace{4mm} Y = 1  \hspace{4mm} Z = 3$
\end{quote}
Finally, the space obtained by adding a propagator for 
$ X\neq 6$ can also be solved by propagation, yielding 
the third and final solution
\begin{quote}
 $ X = 8  \hspace{4mm} Y = 1  \hspace{4mm} Z = 5$
\end{quote}
An alternative to the propagate and branch method 
is a naive enumerate and test method, 
which would enumerate all triples (X, Y, Z) admitted 
by the initial domain constraints and test the 
constraints $ X \neq 7, Z \neq 2 $ , and $ X - Z = 3\cdot Y$ 
for each triple. There are 8 * 10 * 10 = 800 candidates. 
This shows that constraint propagation can reduce the size 
of the search tree considerably.



\subsection{Branching Strategies}
A \emph{branching strategy} is used when propagation alone is not
strong enough to yield a solution of a constraint problem. After
computing the fixpoint of all propagators, the branching strategy
determines which constraints should be added in order to obtain two or
more branches of the current node in the search tree.

Usually, a branching strategy is defined on a sequence 
$x_1,\ldots,x_n$ of variables. When a 
branching step is necessary, the strategy selects a not 
yet determined variable in the sequence 
and branches on this variable.

There are a few standard possibilities to branch on a 
variable x:
\begin{itemize}
\item
branch with x = l, where l is the least possible value 
for x.
\item
branch with x = u, where u is the largest possible 
value for x.
\item
branch with x = m, where m is a possible value for 
x that is in the middle of the least and 
largest possible value for x.
\item
branch with $ x \le m$ , where m is a possible 
value for x that is in the middle of the 
least and largest possible value for x (so called 
\emph{domain splitting}).
\end{itemize}

A \emph{naive branching strategy} will select the 
leftmost undetermined variable in the sequence.

A \emph{first-fail branching strategy} will select 
the leftmost undetermined variable in the 
sequence whose domain in the constraint store has minimal 
size. In other words, it will select 
the leftmost undetermined variable for which the number 
of different possible values is minimal.
For most problems in this tutorial,
first-fail strategies yield much smaller 
search trees than naive strategies.

\subsection{Search Order}
So far we have not specified in which order search trees 
are explored. Although this order 
has no impact on the shape and size of a search tree, 
it does have an impact on the time and
 memory resources needed to find one or all solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
If we are only interested in one solution, there is no 
need to explore the entire search tree. 
Ideally, we would just explore the path leading from the 
root to the solution.
\item
If we are interested in all solutions, we need to explore 
the entire search tree. However, 
whether we explore the tree in depth-first or breadth-first 
manner will make a big difference 
in the memory needed. The memory requirements of breadth-first 
exploration are typically 
exponentially larger than those of depth-first exploration.
\end{itemize}
We will assume that the search engine explores the search trees always
in a depth-first fashion.  Moreover, when the branching strategy
results in $n$ branches for some node, the search engine will explore
those branches from left to right (i.e. from branch number one to
number $n$).

The above assumptions ensure that the exploration of a search tree is
a deterministic process, provided the branching strategy generating
the constraints to branch with is deterministic.

\section{Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Models and Viewpoints}
In section \ref{sec 2} the two basic techniques to solve
constraint problems, propagate and branch, have been introduced.

In practice, the first step when confronted with a problem is to think
of how this problem can be modeled, i.e. what variables, what
domains for these variables, and what constraints
should be used to encode the problem.

In the following, we present \emph{Constraint Satisfaction Problems}
as an abstract, but formal view of a single \emph{model} of a problem.
Then we introduce \emph{viewpoints}, focusing on the problem variables
and their initial domains. A viewpoints naturally leads to a model for
a problem, as will be exemplified using the Sudoku puzzle.

\subsection{Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and Models}
A \emph{Constraint Satisfaction Problem}(CSP), is a triple
$<$ X, D, C $>$ with: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
X is a set of variables \{$x_1, \ldots, x_n$\}
\item
D = \{$ D_1, \ldots, D_n$\} is a set 
of associated domains for all $x_i \in$ X
\item
C is a set of constraints
\end{itemize}
A CSP \emph{M} is called \emph{model} for a problem \emph{P}
if every solution of \emph{P} is also determined by
the solutions to \emph{M}.

The first two elements of the triple have a special
meaning because they are the first thing we have to think
about when modeling a constraint problem. These two 
sets X, D can be defined as the \emph{viewpoint} of a
problem, presented next.
  
\subsection{Viewpoint}
\label{viewp}
The term \emph{viewpoint} goes back to Geelen \cite{6} when
discussing permutation problems. Lee and Law \cite{7} adopted
that concept and formally defined it.

A \emph{viewpoint} is a pair (X,D), where X = \{$x_1, \ldots, x_n$\} 
is a set of variables, and D = \{$ D_1, \ldots, D_n$\} is a set 
of associated domains for all $x_i \in$ X.

Once having choosen the variables and their domains, the next
step is to search for a set of constraints such that the solutions 
to the problem are determined by the solution to the constraints.
Obviously, the choice of the viewpoint affects the set of
constraints we need. So, different viewpoints for a problem
result in different sets of constraints and finally in completely
different models for a problem.
 

\subsection{Example: Sudoku Puzzle}
\label{sudoku-puzzle}
\subsubsection{History}
Howard Garnes, a freelance puzzle constructor and retired architect, has
designed the puzzle in 1979. It was first published in New York in the late 1970s by the specialist puzzle publisher Dell Magazines in its magazine Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games, under the title Number Place. 
The puzzle was introduced in Japan by Nikoli 1984 as "Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru", which can be translated as "the numbers must be single" or "the numbers must occur only once".

\subsubsection{Problem Description}
Sudoku is a puzzle played on a partially filled 9 x 9 grid. The task 
is to complete the assignment using numbers from 1 to 9 such that the 
entries in each row, each column and each major 3 x 3 block are pairwise 
different. Below are given two tables (taken from the paper
\cite{8}); the first (\ref{sudoku-problem}) 
is showing a Sudoku Problem
and the second (\ref{sudoku-sol}) a solution to this problem.
By choosing  a 'good' viewpoint, most instances of the Sudoku Puzzle can be
solved without search.

\subsubsection{Viewpoints for the Sudoku Problem}
In the following two different approaches to model
the \emph{Sudoku Problem} are shown:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_{81}$ represent all boxes
in the grid, and the domain of each variable is the set
of integers \{1, $\ldots$, 9\}, i.e. the values every box
can have; an assignment $x_i$ = c means that the i-th box
has the value c.
\item
the variables $\mathit{nb}_1, \ldots, \mathit{nb}_9$ represent the numbers
1, $\ldots$, 9, and the domain of every number is the power set
$\mathcal{P}\{1, \dots, 81\}$, i.e. the boxes a number occurs; an
assignment $\mathit{nb}_i$ = \{$c_1, \ldots, c_n $\} means that number i occurs
in box $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ and \{$c_1, \ldots, c_n $ \} is a subset of 
\{1, $\ldots$, 81\}.
\end{enumerate}
\db{In the first viewpoint you only need the propagator \emph{distinct(s,v)}
that is already implemented in the Alice library and that ensures
that all elements of the vector \emph{v} are distinct in space
\emph{s}, i.e. pairwise non-equal}. 
To achieve the requirements of the Sudoku Problem you have to
use the distinct propagator for each row, each column and each
3 x 3 box.

In the second viewpoint, rules are more awkward to express.
You have to guarantee that the cardinality of every set representing
a number is 9, that all those sets are disjoint, that every number
has exactly one value in every row and every column and exactly one
value in every 3 x 3 box.
% Both models can be implemented in Alice and are shown in ...

\subsection{Selecting Viewpoints}
As already said in section \ref{viewp}, different viewpoints can
result in completely different models for a problem. Since these
resulting models often need sets of constraints that both differ 
in size and complexity of their propagators, the art in constraint 
programming consists in finding viewpoints that maximize the CSP's
efficiency.

When modeling a problem, you should prefer a viewpoint that needs
the fewest set of constraints. In addition, it does not only suffice
to have a smallest set of constraints, these constraints are also
required to have low complexity and efficient propagation algorithms. 
As a matter of course you should always use the viewpoints in a way that
the constraints and finally the model itself can be clearly described.

\section{Writing Problem Solvers in Alice}

We are now well-prepared to write and run our first finite 
domain problem solvers in Alice. 
For running, analyzing, and debugging problem solvers we 
will use the Explorer, a graphical 
tool of the Alice programming environment.

A \emph{script} for a finite domain problem is a program 
that implements a model for the problem. 
In Alice, scripts will be run on predefined 
search engines implementing the propagate 
and branch method just described. Separating scripts 
from the search engines running them 
is an important abstraction making it possible to design 
scripts at a very high level. To 
develop a script for a given problem, we start by designing 
a model, i.e. a \db{viewpoint (see \ref{viewp}) and a branching strategy}. 
We then obtain an executable script by implementing the model 
and branching strategy with the 
predefined abstractions available in Alice. 


\subsection{Format of Scripts}
In Alice a script is a function $ f : space \rightarrow $ \emph{t} 
that takes the following form:
\begin{quote}
fun f space = let
\begin{quote}
\hspace{15mm}\textcolor{red}{\# declare problem variables}
\end{quote} 
\begin{quote}
\hspace{15mm} in
\end{quote} 
\begin{quote}
\hspace{15mm}\textcolor{red}{\# post constraints}
\end{quote} 
\begin{quote}
\hspace{15mm}\textcolor{red}{\# specify branching strategy}
\end{quote} 
\begin{quote}
\hspace{15mm}end
\end{quote}             
\end{quote}


The procedure declares the variables needed, 
posts the constraints modeling the problem, 
and specifies the branching strategy.
The argument \emph{space} stands for the 
computational architecture mentioned in 
\ref{space}.
The result type \emph{t} is called 
the \emph{interface} and is used to specify
a solution of the problem.
Often, the result type is just a record of the 
problem variables.

There are two ways to obtain the solutions of a 
CSP. \db{One way is by \emph{off-line search}
using the functions from the
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{Search}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/search.html}
library structure}. 
The other
and easiest way is to interactively explore the 
induced search tree by using the
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{Explorer}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/explorer.html}.

The Explorer  must first be imported:
\begin{quote}
import structure Explorer from ''x-alice:/lib/tools/Explorer''
\end{quote}
If you want to get all solutions of the problem, 
you use:
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreAll (script)
\end{quote}
and the script will be run until the entire 
search tree is explored.
With 
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreOne (script)
\end{quote}
you obtain a tree with just one solution.

Now, by double-clicking on a solution node 
(green diamond) of the search tree, a window
will open, called the \emph{Inspector}. The 
inspector shows the variable assignments of
this solution.
If you double-click on an inner node, the 
inspector will display the information available 
at the respective point of the search tree.

\subsection{Example: Send More Money}
We will now write a script for the Send More 
Money Puzzle.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The Send More Money Problem consists in finding 
distinct digits for the letters 
D, E, M, N, O, R, S, Y such that S and M are 
different from zero (no leading zeros) 
and the equation
\begin{quote}
SEND + MORE = MONEY
\end{quote}
is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem 
is 9567 + 1085 = 10652.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
We model the problem by having a variable for 
every letter, where the variable 
stands for the digit associated with the letter,
i.e. every variable has the integer set 
\{0, $\ldots$, 9\} as domain.
 The constraints are obvious 
from the problem specification.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
\label{distribstrat}
We branch on the variables for the letters 
with a first-fail strategy.
The variables are ordered according to the 
alphabetic order of the letters. 
The strategy tries the least possible value 
of the selected variable. 

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Send More Money
    Puzzle},label=listing 1,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
import structure FD from "x-alice:/lib/gecode/FD"
import structure Modeling from "x-alice:/lib/gecode/Modeling"
import structure Explorer from "x-alice:/lib/tools/Explorer"

open Modeling

fun money space =
  let
    val letters as #[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y] = 
               fdtermVec (space, 8, [0`#9])
  in
    distinct (space, letters, FD.DOM);
    post (space, S `<> `0, FD.DOM);
    post (space, M `<> `0, FD.DOM);
    post (space, `1000`*S `+ `100`*E `+ `10`*N `+ D `+               
                 `1000`*M `+ `100`*O `+ `10`*R `+ E
             `=  `10000`*M `+ `1000`*O `+ `100`*N `+ 
                 `10`*E `+ Y, FD.DOM);
    branch (space, letters, FD.B_SIZE_MIN, FD.B_MIN);
    {S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y}
  end
\end{myverbatim}






\db{Listing \ref{listing 1} shows a script realizing the model and
branching strategy just discussed. In the first three lines of 
the script the structures \emph{FD}, \emph{Modeling} and \emph{Explorer}
are imported. This is important to be able to use the methods of the
respective structures. In the following scripts these imports are omitted
for the sake of readability. Be sure not to forget them when testing
the example scripts.\footnote{You find the necessary imports for scripts in the 
\htmladdnormallink{Alice sources}{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/cptutorial/samples/}.}}
The script first declares a vector of finite domain variables,one for every letter. 
This is done via
the function \emph{fdtermVec: space * int * domain $ \rightarrow $ term vector}
included in the structure
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{Modeling}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/modeling.html} from the Gecode 
library. \db{ The function \emph{fdtermVec(s,i,d)} creates a 
new vector of finite domain variables 
with lenght \emph{i}
and every variable has to range over a finte 
set of integers specified by
\emph{d} ( so it is a basic constraint)}. 
Then the script posts the
following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The fields of the vector \emph{letters} are pairwise 
distinct. This is
realized with the predefined propagator \\
\emph{distinct : space * term vector * conlevel $ \rightarrow $ 
unit}, also included
in the Modeling library. \emph{Conlevel} refers to 
the strength of
propagation, i.e. for most propagators you can select 
\emph{interval propagation} (FD.BND)
or \emph{domain propagation} (FD.DOM). 
This constraint 
is nonbasic.
\item
\db{The values of the variables S and M are different 
from zero (no
leading zeros). These constraints are basic}.
\item
The digits for the letters satisfy the equation
SEND + MORE = MONEY. This constraint is nonbasic.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Posting of constraints}
Posting of constraints is defined differently for basic and 
nonbasic constraints. Basic constraints are posted by telling 
them to the constraint store. Nonbasic constraints are posted 
by creating propagators implementing them.

\db{Note that the modelling tools for $ S \neq 0 $ and $ M \neq 0$ can 
immediately write their complete information into the constraint 
store since the store already knows domains for S and M}. 

The line \emph{branch (space, letters, $ FD.B\_SIZE\_MIN, FD.B\_MIN$)} posts 
a branching that will branch on the vector letters with the 
\textbf{first-fail} strategy (specified by $FD.B\_SIZE\_MIN$ and $FD.B\_MIN$). 
$\emph{FD.B\_SIZE\_MIN}$ controls which undetermined variable will be
selected and \emph{$ FD.B\_MIN $} determines which value of that variable
will be selected.

If you now import for example the structure
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{Search}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/search.html}
from the Gecode library with:
\begin{quote}
import structure Search from ``x-alice:/lib/Gecode/Search``
\end{quote}
and you type in the command:
\begin{quote}
Search.searchAll smm
\end{quote}
you obtain the list of all solutions and the result record
(by depth-first search):
\begin{quote}
Space.space list *
\begin{quote}
      \{D : term, E : term, M : term, N : term, O : term, R : term, S : term,
       Y : term\} =
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
   $ ([\_val],$\\
   $ \{D = FD (\_val), E = FD (\_val), M = FD (\_val), N = FD (\_val),$\\ 
   $ O = FD (\_val), R = FD (\_val), S = FD (\_val), Y = FD (\_val)\})$\\
\end{quote}
\end{quote}


The actual solutions could now be extracted from the result 
record using the functions from the
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{FD.Reflect}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/fd.html}
library structure.

To understand the search process defined by \emph{smm}, we need more 
information than just the list of solutions found. Obviously, it would 
be useful to see a graphical representation of the search tree. It
would also be nice if we could see for every node of the search tree 
what information about the solution was accumulated in the constraint 
store when the respective space became stable. Finally, it would be
nice to see for every arc of the tree with which constraint it was 
branched.

Figure \ref{figure4} shows the search tree explored by smm together 
with the information just mentioned. This gives us a good
understanding of the search process defined by smm. Note that the 
search tree is quite small compared to the $ 10^8 $ candidates a naive 
generate and test method would have to consider.


\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.3]{figs/fig5.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{The search tree explored by smm}}
\label{figure4}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Explorer}
The Explorer is a graphical tool of the Alice programming
environment. It can run scripts and display the explored search
trees. It can also display the information in the constraint stores 
associated with the nodes of the search tree.

The statement:
\begin{quote}
Explorer.ExploreAll smm
\end{quote}
tells the Explorer to run the script smm and explore the entire search 
tree. The Explorer will pop up a window and display the explored nodes 
of the search tree (see Figure \ref{figure5}). Choice nodes appear 
as blue circles, failure nodes as red boxes, and solution nodes as
green diamonds. Fully explored subtrees not containing solution nodes 
are collapsed into a single red triangle. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{figs/smm1.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{The Explorer with the compact search tree of smm.}}
\label{figure5}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Selecting nodes}
\db{You can select any node of the displayed search tree (excepting a
failure node) by clicking it with the left mouse button. 
It is also possible to select the parent node of a node that
is actually selected with the command (Ctrl + Up), the left child node
(the selected node is an open choice node) with the command (Ctrl + Down). 
Is the left child a failure node, the right child is selected. Further, you can select
a left sibling (resp. right sibling) with the command (Ctrl + Left) (resp.
(Ctrl + Right)). Again, none of the commands above can select a failure node!}

\subsubsection{Hiding nodes}
\db{Select the red triangle and type the command \emph{H} (hide/unhide). 
This will replace the triangle with the 
actual nodes of the tree (see Figure \ref{figure6}). 
You now see the full search tree of smm , which consists of three choice nodes, 
three failure nodes, and one solution node. Typing the command h once 
more will switch back to the compact representation of the failed
subtree. It is not only failed subtrees that you can hide with
the command \emph{H}. If you hide a subtree with command \emph{H} and
there is a solution node in that subtree, a big green triangle replaces
that subtree. If there is an open choice node in the subtree, a big
green triangle with a small grey triangle appears. The command
\emph{F} just hides failed subtrees.}
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.5]{figs/smm2.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{The Explorer with the full search tree of smm}}
\label{figure6}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Double clicking nodes}
Next, double-click the green solution node with the left mouse button.
\db{A new window is popped - up by the \emph{Alice Inspector}.
It will display the unique solution 
of the Money Puzzle (see figure \ref{figure7})}. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=1.0]{figs/inspector1.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{The Inspector showing the solution of smm}}
\label{figure7}
\end{figure}
You can also double click a blue choice node. 
This will display the information about the solution 
that was accumulated in the constraint store before the node was
branched. Double clicking the top node of the tree, for instance, 
results in figure \ref{figure8}.
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{figs/inspector2.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{The Inspector showing the result at the first choice node}}
\label{figure8}
\end{figure}
This way, the Explorer and the Inspector can display the 
annotated search tree shown in Figure \ref{figure4}.

\subsubsection{Open and closed choice nodes}
The statement
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreOne smm
\end{quote}
tells the Explorer to run the script smm until the first solution is 
found. \db{This time the Explorer will show a partial search tree that 
contains the solution node in the lefttmost position}, and also
contains an \emph{open choice node}. An open choice node is a choice 
node for which not all direct descendents have been explored yet. A 
closed choice node is a choice node for which all direct descendents 
have been explored already. \db{While closed choice nodes are displayed 
as blue circles, open choice nodes are displayed as grey triangles}. Not yet 
explored descendents of an open choice node are not displayed.

To check whether there are further solutions, you can resume the 
search process by selecting the root node and typing the command \emph{N}
(next). This will resume the search until either the next solution 
is found or all nodes of the search tree are explored.

\subsubsection{Stopping exploration}
\db{You can stop the exploring Explorer at any time with the command \emph{Ctrl + C}}.

\subsubsection{Resuming exploration}
\db{You can resume the exploration of a partial search tree by selecting 
any choice node and typing the command \emph{N} or \emph{A}}. The command \emph{N} (next) 
will resume the exploration of the selected subtree until a further 
solution is found or the subtree is fully explored. The command \emph{A}
(all) will resume the exploration of the selected subtree until it 
is fully explored.

\subsubsection{Resetting the Explorer}
\db{The command \emph{Ctrl + R} will reset the Explorer and show only the root node of 
the search tree (grey triangle). You 
can request the exploration of the seach tree by typing \emph{N} or \emph{A}}.

\subsubsection{Hand-guided exploration}
\db{You can guide the search of the Explorer by hand. Reset the Explorer 
by typing \emph{Ctrl + R}. This will select the root node, which is an open choice 
node. Now type the command \emph{S} to compute the first descendents of 
the root. Now, you can select another open choice node and compute its first 
descendants. You can repeat this exploration until no open choice nodes are left.}


\subsubsection{Zooming the search tree}
\db{The right vertical scroll bar of the Explorer's window zooms the 
size of the displayed search tree. You can zoom the tree to fit 
the size of the window by clicking the zoom button above the
vertical scroll bar with the left mouse button}.

\subsection{Example: Safe}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The code of Professor Smart's safe is a sequence of 9 distinct nonzero
digits $ C_1,\ldots,C_9 $ such that the following equations and
inequations are satisfied:
\begin{eqnarray*}{c}
  C_4 - C_6 & = & C_7 \\
  C_1 * C_2 * C_3 & = & C_8 + C_9 \\
  C_2 + C_3 + C_6 & < & C_8 \\
  C_9 & < & C_8 \\
  C_1\neq 1,\ldots, C_9\neq 9
\end{eqnarray*}


Can you determine the code?

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Branching Strategy}
You should model the problem by choosing a variable for every digit $
C_1,\ldots,C_9 $ and branch over these variables with the standard
first-fail strategy. This time, the variables range over
\{1, $\ldots$, 9\}.


\subsubsection{Script}


\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Safe Puzzle},label=listing 2,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun safe space = 
   let
      val letters as #[c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9]= 
          FD.intvarVec(space,9,#[(1,9)])
      fun not_equalv vec space = Vector.appi(fn (i,x) => 
                     post(space,FD(x) `<> `i `+ `1,FD.DOM)) vec
   in
      FD.distinct(space,letters,FD.DOM);
      post(space,FD(c4)`- FD(c6) `= FD(c7),FD.DOM);
      post(space,FD(c1)`* FD(c2)`* FD(c3)`= FD(c8)`+ FD(c9),FD.DOM);        
      post(space,FD(c2)`+ FD(c3)`+ FD(c6)`< FD(c8),FD.DOM);
      post(space,FD(c9)`< FD(c8),FD.DOM);
      not_equalv letters space;
      FD.branch(space,letters,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_MIN);
      {c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9}
    end 

\end{myverbatim}




\db{Listing \ref{listing 2} shows a simple script for the Safe Puzzle.
First, the script introduces a vector of type \emph{intvar}, with one 
finite domain variable for every digit. The script also defines two additional
temporary finite domain variables whose use will be explained later and a help
function that posts the constraint $c.i \neq i\hspace{2mm}$ for every 
$\hspace{2mm} i = 1,\ldots,9$. In the application
part of the \emph{let -  construct}, the first constraint ensures that all digits
are distinct. The next six constraints that are posted guarantee that the 
equations and inequations of the Safe problem are satisfied \footnote{Sometimes
you recognize a \emph{FD} with the finite domain variables. This is important because the {\it
post} method gets besides the others one argument of type \emph{term}. \emph{FD} transfers
variables of type \emph{intvar} into type \emph{term} }.}
Finally the branching strategy branches over the vector
\emph{letters}.

The following two figures \ref{figure9} and \ref{figure10} show the 
resulting search-tree of the Safe Puzzle and its unique solution \{4 3 1 8 9 2 6 7 5\}.

\section{Elimination of Symmetries and Defined Constraints}
In this section you will learn two basic constraint programming techniques. 
The first technique consists in \textbf{eliminating symmetries} in the model, 
which often leads to scripts with smaller search trees. The second technique 
introduces \textbf{defined constraints}, which for programmers is not a big
surprise, but still is a means for writing modular and concise scripts.

\subsection{Example: Grocery}
This example illustrates that elimination of symmetries can 
dramatically reduce 
the size of search trees.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. 
The cashier charges \$ 7.11, the kid 
pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, 
and says

``Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them; 
I'll try again; 
Hah, with adding them the price still comes to \$ 7.11 .''

What were the prices of the four items?

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
The viewpoint of our model consits in four variables 
A, B, C, and D, which stand for the 
prices of the four items. In order that the variables
 can be constrained 
to finite domains of integers, we assume that the prices 
are given in cents. 
To say that the sum of the four prices is 711, 
we impose the constraint A + B + C + D = 711, and to say 
that the product 
of the four prices is 711, we impose the constraint
\begin{quote}
A * B * C * D = 711 * 100 * 100 * 100
\end{quote}
The model admits many different equivalent solutions since the 
prices of 
the items can be interchanged. We can eliminate these 
symmetries by imposing an order 
on the prices of the items, for instance,
\begin{quote} 
$ A \le B \le C \le D$
\end{quote}
With these ordering constraints the model has a unique solution.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
For this problem it is advantageous to use a first-fail strategy 
that splits the domain 
of the selected variable and tries the upper part of the domain 
first. This strategy leads 
to a much smaller search tree than the standard first-fail strategy, 
which tries the least 
possible value of the selected variable first. 

\db{
\subsubsection{The use of defined constraints}
In Listing \ref{listing 4} you will recognize that a new function is 
used - \emph{constrain}. It demands for further explanation. 
Listing \ref{listing 3} shows an example how defined constraints are
realized. A new datatype - \emph{constraint} - to modularize propagators 
is declared. Here, a constraint
can be a sum, a product or a '$<$' - relation. 
The \db{procedure} \emph{post(space,SUMV(xs) `= `c,FD.BND)} creates a propagator that 
propagates $ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i   = c $ where the $ x_i $ are the elements of xs
and c is an integer constant.
The other \db{procedure} productRelI propagates $ \pi_{i=1}^n x_i  = c $. To realize this
you need a temporary variable for every product of two variables because \emph{FD.mult}
only can propagate x * y = z. Both procedures use predefined propagators from the
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{FD}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/fd.html}
library.}

\lstset{caption = \textbf{Defined Constraints},label=listing 3,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}

fun product'(space,  _, 0, _) = FD.range(space, (1, 1))
  | product'(space, xs, 1, _) = Vector.sub(xs, 0)
  | product'(space, xs, n, conlevel) =
       Vector.foldl (fn (x, a) =>
          let
             val tmp = FD.range(space, (0, maxValue))
          in
             FD.mult(space, a, x, tmp, conlevel);tmp
          end)
          (product'(space, #[], 0, conlevel))xs
 
fun productRelI(space, xs, rel, c, conlevel) =
   FD.relI(space, 
   product'(space, xs, Vector.length xs, conlevel), rel, c)       
 
datatype constraint =
   SUM of FD.intvar vector * int
 | PRD of FD.intvar vector * int
 | LEQ of FD.intvar * FD.intvar


fun constrain(space, SUM(xs, c)) = 
       post(space,SUMV(xs) `= `c,FD.BND)
  | constrain(space, PRD(xs, c)) = 
       productRelI(space, xs, FD.EQ, c, FD.BND)
  | constrain(space, LEQ( x, y)) = 
       FD.rel(space, x, FD.LQ, y)

\end{myverbatim}


\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Grocery Puzzle},
label=listing 4,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun grocery space =
   let
      (* problem variables *)
      val a = FD.range(space, (0, maxValue))
      val b = FD.range(space, (0, maxValue))
      val c = FD.range(space, (0, maxValue))
      val d = FD.range(space, (0, maxValue))
      val tmp = FD.range(space,(0, maxValue))
      (* interface *)
      val prices = #[a, b, c, d]
   in
      (* problem constraints *)
      constrain(space, SUM(prices,711));
      constrain(space, PRD(prices,maxValue));
      (* symmetry breaking *)
      
      constrain(space, LEQ(a, b));
      constrain(space, LEQ(b, c));
      constrain(space, LEQ(c, d));
      
      (* branching *)
      FD.branch(space,prices,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_SPLIT_MAX);
      {a, b, c, d}
   end
\end{myverbatim}


The script in Listing \ref{listing 4} spawns a huge search tree. 
It will explore 
304 nodes before it finds the unique solution \{120 125 150 316\}.
 Without the ordering constraints 
the script explores more than 450 times as many nodes before
 finding a first solution. 
We learn that the elimination of symmetries may make it easier 
to find the first solution.


\subsubsection{A subtle symmetry}
There exists another symmetry whose elimination leads to a much smaller search tree. 
For this we observe that 711 has the prime factor 79 (711 = 9 * 79). Since the product 
of the prices of the items is 711, we can assume without loss of generality that 79 is 
a prime factor of the price A of the first item. We adapt our script by replacing 
the statement 
\begin{quote}
constrain (space, LEQ(a, b)) 
\end{quote}
with
\begin{quote}
post(space, FD(a) `=  `79  `*  FD(tmp), FD.DOM)
\end{quote}
The new propagator for 
\begin{quote}
a = 79 * tmp
\end{quote} 
reduces the search tree of Grocery to 205 nodes. 
The solution of the problem is now found after exploring 44 nodes.



\newpage
\subsection{Example: Family}
This example also illustrates the use of symmetry elimination and
defined constraints.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Maria and Clara are both heads of households, and both families 
have three boys and three girls. Neither family includes any children closer 
in age than one year, and all children are under age 10. The youngest child 
in Maria's family is a girl, and Clara has just given birth to a little girl.

In each family, the sum of the ages of the boys equals the sum of the ages 
of the girls, and the sum of the squares of the ages of the boys equals the 
sum of the the squares of ages of the girls. The sum of the ages of all children 
is 60.

What are the ages of the children in each family? 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
The viewpoint of this problem consists of 12 variables
and each of these variables is associated with the domain of the integers
0, $\ldots$, 9. 
We model a family as a record
\begin{quote}
\{boys:$ \#[ $B1 B2 B3$]$, girls:$\#[$G1 G2 G3$]$\}
\end{quote}
where the variables B1, B2 and B3 stand for the ages of the boys in descending 
order (i. e., B3 is the age of the youngest boy in the family), and the variables 
G1, G2 and G3 stand for the ages of the girls, also in descending order. This 
representation of a family avoids possible symmetries. The constraints that must 
hold for a family will be posted by the defined constraint \emph{makefamily}.
A solution is a pair consisting of Maria's and Clara's family. 

\subsubsection{Branching Stratgey}
We branch on the list of the ages of the children of the two families following 
a first-fail strategy. The strategy splits the domain of the selected variable and 
tries the lower part of the domain first.

\subsubsection{Script}

\lstset{caption = \textbf{Script for the Family Puzzle},
label=listing 5,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun age_list space =
    let
        val ages as #[a,b,c] = FD.intvarVec(space,3,#[(0,9)])
    in 
        FD.rel(space,a,FD.GR,b);
        FD.rel(space,b,FD.GR,c);
        ages
    end

fun makefamily space =
    let
        val boysages  = age_list space
        val girlsages = age_list space
        val tmp1 = FD.range(space,(0,243))
        val tmp2 = FD.range(space,(0,243))
        val ages as #[a,b,c,d,e,f] = 
                Vector.concat([boysages,girlsages])
        fun squares_sum(#[x,y,z],res)= 
            post(space,FD(x)`* FD(x)`+ 
                       FD(y)`* FD(y)`+
                       FD(z)`* FD(z) `= FD(res),FD.DOM)
    in
        FD.distinct(space,ages,FD.DOM);
        post(space,FD(a) `+ FD(b) `+ FD(c) 
                `= FD(d) `+ FD(e) `+ FD(f),FD.DOM);
        squares_sum(boysages,tmp1);
        squares_sum(girlsages,tmp2);
        FD.rel(space,tmp1,FD.EQ,tmp2);
        {boys= #[Vector.sub(ages,0),Vector.sub(ages,1),
                 Vector.sub(ages,2)],
         girls = #[Vector.sub(ages,3),Vector.sub(ages,4),
                   Vector.sub(ages,5)]}
    end

fun family space = 
    let
        val maria = makefamily space
        val clara = makefamily space
        val ageofmariasyoungestgirl = Vector.sub(#girls maria,2)
        val ageofclarasyoungestgirl = Vector.sub(#girls clara,2)
        val ages = Vector.concat([#boys (maria),#girls (maria),
                                  #boys(clara),#girls(clara)])
    in
        Vector.app(fn x => 
              FD.rel(space,x,FD.GR,ageofmariasyoungestgirl))
                  (#boys maria);
        FD.relI(space,ageofclarasyoungestgirl,FD.EQ,0);
        post(space,SUMV(ages) `= `60,FD.DOM);
        FD.branch(space,ages,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_MIN);
        {maria,clara}
    end         
 
\end{myverbatim}

The procedure \emph{age\_list} ensures that
the elements in the list of boys or girls appear in 
descending order.



\newpage
\subsection{Example: Zebra Puzzle}
This example also illustrates the use of defined constraints and
shows a clever problem representation avoiding possible symmetries.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Five men with different nationalities live in the first five 
houses of a street. There are only houses on one side of the street. 
The men practice distinct professions, and each of them has a favorite 
drink and a favorite animal, all of them different. The five houses are 
painted with different colors. The following facts are known: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The Englishman lives in a red house.
\item
The Spaniard owns a dog.
\item
The Japanese is a painter.
\item
The Italian drinks tea.
\item
The Norwegian lives in the first house.
\item
The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
\item
The green house comes after the white one.
\item
The sculptor breeds snails.
\item
The diplomat lives in the yellow house.
\item
Milk is drunk in the third house.
\item
The Norwegian's house is next to the blue one.
\item
The violinist drinks juice.
\item
The fox is in the house next to that of the doctor.
\item
The horse is in the house next to that of the diplomat.
\item
The zebra is in the white house.
\item
One of the men drinks water.
\end{enumerate}
Who lives where? 


\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
For this problem a viewpoint is choosen consisting in 25
finite domain variables, each associated with the domain \{1,$\ldots$, 5\}.
We number the houses from 1 to 5, where 1 is the first and 5 
is last house in the street. There are 25 different properties 
(i. e. hosting an Englishman, being the green house, hosting a painter, 
hosting a dog, or hosting someone who drinks juice), and each 
of these properties must hold for exactly one house. The properties 
are partitioned into five groups of five members each, where the 
properties within one group must hold for different houses. The model 
has one variable for each of these properties, where the variable 
stands for the number of the house for which this property holds. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables for the properties with the 
standard first-fail strategy. 

\subsubsection{Script}
The defined constraint \emph{adjacent} in Listing \ref{listing 6}
creates a propagator for $|$ X - Y $|$ = 1.

\newpage
\section{Parameterized Scripts}
Combinatorial problems typically occur in a general form that can 
be instantiated with different data sets. This leads to parameterized 
scripts separating the general script from particular data sets.

\subsection{Example: Queens}
Place N queens on an $ N \times N $ chess board such that no two queens 
attack each other. The parameter of the problem is N. A solution for the 
4 - queens problem looks as follows:
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.3]{figs/queens-4.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{A solution to the Queens Problem}}
\label{figure 11}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
We will use a clever viewpoint avoiding possible symmetries and minimizing 
the number of propagators.

Since we want to put one queen into each column, we use the problem
variables $ row[ 0 ], \ldots, row[ N - 1 ]$, one for each column on
the chessboard. Every variable has the set $ \{ 0, \ldots, N - 1 \} $
as initial domain. Now, an assignment $ row[ i ] = j $ means that the
queen in the \emph{i}th column should be placed into the \emph{j}th row.
A solution to the N-queens problem is an assignment that satisfies the
following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item
No two queens are allowed to be placed in the same column.( This constraint
is already coded in the model since we only have one problem variable
per column).
\item
No two queens are allowed to be placed in the same row:
\begin{quote}
$ \forall j \neq i : row[ i ] \neq row[ j ] $
\end{quote}
\item
No two queens are allowed to be placed on the same diagonal:
\begin{quote}
$ \forall i < j : row[ i ] + (j - i) \neq row[ j ] \wedge  row[ i ] - (j - i) \neq row[ j ] $
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables $ row[ 0 ], \ldots, row[ N - 1 ]$ using a 
first-fail strategy that tries the value in the middle of the domain of 
the selected variable first. This strategy works well even for large N. 

\subsubsection{Script}
Listing \ref{listing 7} shows a script for the N - queens problem.
Besides the argument \emph{space} the script now has an additional
parameter n. This parameter is both used to create the vector row of
size n and as an argument to the \emph{upperTriangle} function.

\lstset{caption = \textbf{Script for the N-queens Problem},
label=listing 7,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun queens n space =
   let
      val row = Modeling.fdtermVec(space, n, [0`#(n - 1)])
   in
      Modeling.distinct (space, row, FD.BND);
      List.app (fn (i, j) =>
         let
            val rowi = Vector.sub (row, i)
            val rowj = Vector.sub (row, j)
         in
            post (space, rowi `+ (`j `- `i) `<> rowj, FD.BND);
            post (space, rowi `- (`j `- `i) `<> rowj, FD.BND)
         end) (upperTriangle n);
      Modeling.branch (space, row, FD.B_SIZE_MIN, FD.B_MED);
      row
   end
\end{myverbatim}



The \db{procedure} upperTriangle you see in Listing \ref{listing 8} is used
to create the list of all pairs (i , j) of integers such that:
\begin{quote}
$ 0 \leq i \le j \le N $
\end{quote}  
This list is given as parameter to the \emph{List.app} \db{procedure} and
is used to satisfy the constraint that no two queens are on the
same diagonal. So the resulting list of upperTriangle ensures
that the sequences $ row[ 0 ] - 1, \ldots, row[ N - 1 ] - (N - 1)  $ and
$ row[ 0 ] + 1, \ldots, row[ N - 1] + (N - 1) $ are both
nonrepetitive and therefore reduce the amount of propagators.
\lstset{caption = \textbf{Help functions for the N-queens Problem},
label=listing 8,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun loop i n f = if i >= n then nil else f i :: loop (i + 1) n f

fun upperTriangle n =
   List.concat (loop 0 n 
               (fn i => loop (i + 1) n (fn j => (i, j))))

\end{myverbatim}

\subsubsection{Using global constraints}
The script presented in Listing \ref{listing 7} is not optimal.
For a problem of size 9, the Explorer already needs very long to
search the tree. One problem is that in the script for every
pair of the upperTriangle list two propagators are created. This
is really waste of computational space and time.

\db{In Listing \ref{listing 9} you see an improved script that uses
three vectors, where the first vector is the already known row vector.
The vectors \emph{add} and \emph{sub} are used to build the constraints
$ \forall i,j : row[i] + i  \neq row[j] + j $ and $\forall i,j: 
row[i] - i  \neq row[j] - j $, i.e. there are no two queens placed 
on the same diagonal}.
The optimization now is realized through the use
of the propagator \emph{distinctOffset} of the 
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{\it FD}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/fd.html}
library. DistinctOffset is an extension
of the distinct propagator and has the type:
\begin{quote}
$ space * (int * intvar) vector * conlevel \rightarrow  unit $
\end{quote}

\subsection{Example: Changing Money}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Given bills and coins of different denominations and an amount, 
select a minimal number of bill and coins to pay . One instance of the 
problem assumes that we want to pay the amount of 1.42, and that we have 
6 one dollar bills, 8 quarters (25 cents), 10 dimes (10 cents), 1 nickel 
(5 cents), and 5 pennies (1 cent). 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
To avoid conversions, we assume that the amount to be paid and all 
denominations are specified in the same currency unit (e.g., cents). 
The data is specified by variables $ a_1, \ldots, a_k $ specifying 
the available denominations $ d_i $ and the number $ a_i $ of available 
respective coins or bills.

The viewpoint has a variable for ever available denomination saying how many 
of the corresponding bills or coins we will use to pay the amount. For all i, 
we must have $ 0 \leq C_i \leq a_i $. Moreover, we must satisfy the constraint 
\begin{quote}
$ d_1 * C_1 + d_2 * C_2 + \ldots + d_k * C_k = amount $
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables $ C_1, C_2, \ldots $, where we give precedence 
to larger denominations
and, with second priority, to larger values. 

\subsubsection{Script}
In Listing \ref{listing 10} 
The procedure changeMoney takes three parameters. Besides the standard
argument \emph{space}, it needs a vector of records - \emph{billsandcoins}
where each field specifies a denomination's value in cents and how many 
coints of that denomination are available. The second argument 
\emph{amount} specifies the result of the linear equation mentioned above.
 It is assumed that the 
bills and coins are specified in denomination decreasing order.

\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Changing Money
      Problem},label=listing 10,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
(* billsandcoins is a vector of pairs where the first component
   specifies the value of a coin in cents and the second the
   the amount of available coins *)
   val billsandcoins = #[{incents=100,avail=6},
                         {incents=25,avail=8},
                         {incents=10,avail=10},
                         {incents=5,avail=1},
                         {incents=1,avail=5}];

\subsection{Example: Sukoku Puzzle}
\label{sudoku-puzzle2}
The problem description of the Sudoku Puzzle is already given
in section \ref{sudoku-puzzle}. There are also shown two viewpoints
for this problem. Here, we want to realize the first viewpoint in
Alice. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
\db{The variables $x_1, \ldots, x_{81}$ represent all boxes
in the grid, and the domain of each variable is the set
of integers \{1, $\ldots$, 9\}, i.e. the values every box
can have; an assignment $x_i$ = c means that the i-th box
has the value c.}

In the following example, the domain
of the variables $x_1, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_9, x_{11}, 
x_{12}, x_{14}, x_{16}, x_{17}$ is unrestricted, i.e. 
values of the set \{1, $\ldots$, 9\} ( in
the first two rows).
By contrast, the domain of the variables in the first two rows,
that are not already mentioned above, is determined.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
\db{We use a strategy that picks the variable with the smallest lower bound,
splits the domain 
of the selected variable and tries the upper part of the domain 
first. This strategy leads 
to a smaller search tree than the standard first-fail strategy, 
which tries the least 
possible value of the selected variable first}. 


\subsubsection{Script}
The procedure \emph{sukoku1} gets as argument a list of
triples (a,b,c), where (a,b) is the address of the variable 
in the grid and c is its value. It first constrains the
boxes to the input and then it posts the constraints given in
the problem description.

\section{Minimizing a Cost Function}
In many applications one is interested in solutions 
that minimize a given cost function. If the cost function 
is simple enough, we can obtain the minimization effect by 
employing a two-di\-men\-sio\-nal branching strategy.

This section will present two examples, map coloring and 
conference scheduling, for which a two-di\-men\-sio\-nal branching 
strategy suffices. 

\subsection{Example: Coloring a Map}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Given a map showing the West European countries Netherlands, 
Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Luxemburg, Switzerland, 
Austria, and Italy, find a coloring such that neighboring 
countries have different color and a minimal number of colors is used. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
This viewpoint's variable set consists of eleven elements:
we have a variable \emph{nbColors} saying how many different colors we can use. 
Moreover, we have a vector \emph{countries1 }, containing a variable for every country .
We represent colors as numbers. Hence we constrain all variables 
for countries to integers in 1 $\#$ nbColors. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We first branch on nbColors, trying the numbers 1, 2,$\ldots$ in ascending order. 
After nbColors is determined, we branch on the variables for the 
countries using the usual first-fail strategy. 

\subsubsection{Script}
The script in Listing \ref{listing 12} uses the procedure \emph{borderTo}
to guarantee that no two countries that have a common border can
have the same color.

\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Map Coloring Problem},
label=listing 12,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun mapColoring space =
 let
    val nbColors = FD.range(space,(1,10))
    val countries as #[au,ge,ne,sw,be,ita,po,fr,lu,sp] =
            FD.rangeVec(space,10,(1,10))
    (* borderTo gets a country and its neighbours and
          ensures they do not have the same color *) 
    fun borderTo(space,c,nvec)=
                Vector.app(fn x => FD.rel(space,c,FD.NQ,x))nvec
 in
    FD.branch(space,#[nbColors],FD.B_NONE,FD.B_MIN);
    Vector.app(fn x => FD.rel(space,x,FD.LQ,nbColors))countries;
    borderTo(space,au,#[ita,sw,ge]);
    borderTo(space,be,#[fr,ne,ge,lu]);
    borderTo(space,fr,#[sp,lu,ita]);
    borderTo(space,ge,#[au,fr,lu,ne]);
    borderTo(space,sp,#[po]);
    borderTo(space,sw,#[ita,fr,ge,au]);
    FD.branch(space,countries,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_MIN);
    { netherlands = ne, belgium = be, france = fr, spain = sp,
      portugal = po, germany = ge, luxemburg = lu, italy = ita,
      switzerland = sw, austria = au, nbColors}
 end
\end{myverbatim}


The search tree of \emph{mapColoring} is interesting.First, 
colorings with 1, 2 and 3 colors are searched and not found. 
Then a coloring with 4 colors is searched. Now a solution is 
found quickly, without going through further failure nodes. 
There are many solutions using 4 colors since the particular 
color given to a country does not matter.

The statement
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreOne(mapColoring);
\end{quote}
results in the following solution:
\begin{quote}
\{austria = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, 
 belgium = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, 
 france = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, \\
 germany = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\}, 
 italy = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\}, 
 luxemburg = intvar\{$|$4 $|$\}, \\
 nbColors = intvar\{$|$4 $|$\}, 
 netherlands = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, 
 portugal = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, \\
 spain = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, 
 switzerland = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}\}
\end{quote}



\newpage
\subsection{Example: Conference}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
We want to construct the time table of a conference. 
The conference will consist of 11 sessions of equal length. 
The time table is to be organized as a sequence of slots, 
where a slot can take up to 3 parallel sessions. There are 
the following constraints on the timing of the sessions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Session 4 must take place before Session 11.
\item
Session 5 must take place before Session 10.
\item
Session 6 must take place before Session 11.
\item
Session 1 must not be in parallel with Sessions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. 
\item
Session 2 must not be in parallel with Sessions 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11. 
\item
Session 3 must not be in parallel with Sessions 5, 6, and 8. 
\item
Session 4 must not be in parallel with Sessions 6, 8, and 10. 
\item
Session 6 must not be in parallel with Sessions 7 and 10. 
\item
Session 7 must not be in parallel with Sessions 8 and 9. 
\item
Session 8 must not be in parallel with Session 10. 
\end{itemize}
The time table should minimize the number of slots.  

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
The model has a variable \emph{nbSlots} saying how many slots 
the conference has. Here, nbSlots can be constrained to the finite 
domain $ \dom{4}{11} $. The model also has a variable $\emph{plan}_i $ for 
every session \emph{i}, where $\emph{plan}_i $ stands 
for the number of the slot in which Session i will take place. 
Every variable $\emph{plan}_i $ can be constrained to the finite 
domain $ 1 \# $ nbSlots. The remaining constraints are obvious from 
the problem description. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We use a two-dimensional branching strategy. 
We first branch on nbSlots, trying smaller values first. 
Once nbSlots is determined, we branch on the variables $\emph{plan}_i $  
using the standard first-fail strategy. 

\subsubsection{Script}
The script in Listing \ref{listing 13} first creates a local
variable nbSlots specifying the number of slots used by the 
conference. It also defines two procedures \emph{precedes} and
\emph{notparallel} that realize scheduling constraints and
should be easy to understand. It then branches naively on
nbSlots. After nbSlots is determined, it constrains its 
variable \emph{plan}.

The statement 
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreOne(conference)
\end{quote}
will explore the search tree until the first solution is found. 
The first solution minimizes the number of slots and looks as follows: 
\begin{quote}
\{x1 = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\},\\
  x10 = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\}, \\
 x11 = intvar\{$|$4 $|$\}, \\
 x2 = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, \\
 x3 = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\},\\ 
 x4 = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, \\
 x5 = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, \\
 x6 = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, \\
 x7 = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\}, \\
 x8 = intvar\{$|$4 $|$\}, \\
 x9 = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}\}
\end{quote}
This plan says that the conference requires 4 slots, 
where the sessions 1, 4 and 9 take place in slot 1, the sessions 2, 
5 and 6 take place in slot 2, the sessions 3, 7 and 10 take place in 
slot 3, and the sessions 8 and 11 take place in slot 4.

\section{Propagators for Redundant Constraints}
\label{redundant}
For some problems, the performance of a script can 
be drastically improved by introducing propagators 
for redundant constraints. \emph{Redundant constraints} are 
constraints that are entailed by the constraints specifying 
the problem. Additional propagators for redundant constraints 
may decrease the size of the search tree by strengthening 
the propagation component of the script.

\subsection{Example: Fractions}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The Fractions Puzzle consists in finding 
distinct nonzero digits such that the following 
equation holds:\db{ 
\begin{quote}
$ \frac{A}{BC} +  \frac{D}{EF} +  \frac{G}{HI}  = 1 $
\end{quote}}

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
We have a variable for every letter, similar as 
in the Send More Money Puzzle. Since the three fractions 
are symmetric, we can impose the order 
\begin{quote}
$ \frac{A}{BC} \ge  \frac{D}{EF} \ge  \frac{G}{HI} $
\end{quote}
From the order constraints we obtain the redundant 
constraints 
\begin{quote}
$ 3\frac{A}{BC} \ge 1 $ and $3\frac{G}{HI} \le 1 $
\end{quote}
The order constraints together with the redundant 
constraints reduce the size of the search tree by one order 
of magnitude. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the list of letters using the standard 
first-fail strategy.

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{Script for the Fractions Problem},
label=listing 14,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun fractions space =
        let 
            val letters as #[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i]=
                FD.rangeVec(space,9,(1,9))
            val bc = FD.range(space,(1,81))
            val ef = FD.range(space,(1,81))
            val hi = FD.range(space,(1,81))
        in
            FD.distinct(space, letters, FD.DOM);
            post(space,`10 `* FD(b) `+ FD(c) `= FD(bc),FD.DOM);
            post(space,`10 `* FD(e) `+ FD(f) `= FD(ef),FD.DOM);
            post(space,`10 `* FD(h) `+ FD(i) `= FD(hi),FD.DOM);   
            post(space,FD(a) `* FD(ef) `* FD(hi) `+
                       FD(d) `* FD(bc) `* FD(hi) `+
                       FD(g) `* FD(bc) `* FD(ef) `= 
                       FD(bc) `* FD(ef) `* FD(hi),FD.DOM);
            (* impose canonical order *)
            post(space,FD(a) `* FD(ef) `>= FD(d) `* FD(bc),FD.DOM);
            post(space,FD(d) `* FD(hi) `>= FD(g) `* FD(ef),FD.DOM);
            (* redundant constraints *)
            post(space,`3 `* FD(a) `>= FD(bc),FD.DOM);
            post(space,`3 `* FD(g) `<= FD(hi),FD.DOM);
            FD.branch(space,letters,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_MIN);
            {letters}  
       end     
\end{myverbatim}

The script constrains its problem variable letters to a vector 
having a field for every letter. Since Alice has no finite domain 
propagators for fractions, we eliminate the fractions by multiplying 
with the denominators. For every denominator we introduce an auxiliary 
variable. 


\newpage
\subsection{Example: Pythagoras}
Not all propagators exploit coreferences in products 
(e.g. $ x * x + y * y = z * z $). For the example of 
this section it will be essential to exploit such 
coreferences, and you will learn how to do it.

The example also illustrates the case where a propagator 
for a redundant constraint improves the performance of a 
script by decreasing the number of necessary propagation 
steps, but without significantly changing the search tree. 

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
How many triples (A,B,C) exist such that $ A^2 + B^2 = C^2 $ 
and $ A \le B \le C \le 1000 $? 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
The model has three variables A, B and C. Each variable is 
constrained to the finite domain 1 $\#$ 1000. The model imposes 
the constraints  $ A^2 + B^2 = C^2 $ and $ A \le B \le C $.

The script will also create a propagator for the redundant 
constraint 2 * $B^2 \ge C^2$. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables A, B, C  using the standard

fun pythagoras space =
   let
      (* problem variables *)
      val a = FD.range (space, (1, 1000))
      val b = FD.range (space, (1, 1000))
      val c = FD.range (space, (1, 1000))
      (* squares *)
      val aa = FD.range (space, (0, maxValue))

      FD.mult (space, c, c, cc, FD.BND);
      (* problem constraints *)
      FD.linear (space, #[(1, aa), (1, bb), (~1, cc)], FD.EQ, 0, FD.BND);

      FD.branch (space, #[a, b, c], FD.B_SIZE_MIN, FD.B_MIN);
      {a, b, c}
   end
\end{myverbatim}

You can see, that for all squares new variables \emph{aa, bb, cc}
are introduced in Listing \ref{listing 15}. This is a very important
step in this script. As you already know, it is also possible to
\db{use the \emph{post} - modelling tool}. Then you would not need to write:
\begin{quote}
 val aa = FD.range (space, (0, maxValue))\\
 val bb = FD.range (space, (0, maxValue))\\
 val cc = FD.range (space, (0, maxValue))\\
 FD.mult (space, a, a, aa, FD.BND);\\
 FD.mult (space, b, b, bb, FD.BND);\\
 FD.mult (space, c, c, cc, FD.BND);\\
and\\
 FD.linear (space,$ \#$[(1, aa), (1, bb), (~1, cc)], FD.EQ, 0, FD.BND);
\end{quote}
You just have to insert the following two new constraints:
\begin{quote}
 post(space,FD(a) `* FD(a) `+ FD(b) `* FD(b) `= FD(c) `* FD(c),FD.DOM);
\end{quote}
and replace
\begin{quote}
 FD.linear (space, $\#$[(2, bb), (~1, cc)], FD.GQ, 0, FD.BND);
\end{quote}
with
\begin{quote}
post(space,`2 `* FD(b) `* FD(b) `$>$ FD(b) `* FD(b), FD.DOM);
\end{quote}

This would result in a more readable and convenient script, but
comparing the search trees of the two versions, the new version
is worse. But why?

It is because of the variables \emph{aa, bb, cc}. In the first
version( Listing \ref{listing 15}), the redundant constraint
propagates stronger, because its variables are connected to
the propagator ensuring the squares. In the second version they
are independent.

\subsection{Example: Magic Squares}

The model will eliminate symmetries by imposing order 
constraints. Propagation will be drastically improved by 
exploiting a redundant constraint. 

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The Magic Square Puzzle consists in finding for given N
an N x N  - matrix such that:
\begin{itemize} 
\item
Every field of the matrix is an integer between 1 and $N^2$.
\item
The fields of the matrix are pairwise distinct.
\item
The sums of the rows, columns, and the two main diagonals
 are all equal.
\end{itemize}
A magic square for N = 3 looks as follows:
\begin{quote}
2 \hspace{4mm} 7 \hspace{4mm}6\\
9 \hspace{4mm} 5 \hspace{4mm}1\\
4 \hspace{4mm} 3 \hspace{4mm}8
\end{quote}
The Magic Square Puzzle is extremely hard for large N. 
Even for N = 4, our script will have to explore more 
than 10000 
nodes to find a solution. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
We model the problem by having a variable $F_{ij}$ for every field 
(i,j) of the matrix. Moreover, we have one additional variable S 
and require that the sum of every row, column, and main diagonal 
equals S.

Without loss of generality, we can impose the following order 
constraints eliminating symmetries: 
\begin{quote}
$F_{11} < F_{NN}$ \hspace{4mm}$F_{N1} < F_{1N}$ \hspace{4mm}$F_{11} < F_{N1}$
\end{quote}
Since the sum of the sums of the rows must equal the sum of all 
fields, we have the redundant constraint
\begin{quote}
$\frac{N^2}{2}$ * ($N^2$ + 1) = N * S
\end{quote} 
To see this, note that sum of all fields equals 
\begin{quote}
1 + 2 + 3 + $\ldots$ + $N^2$ = $\frac{N^2}{2}$ * ($N^2$ + 1)
\end{quote}
and that the sum of each of the N rows must be S. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables  $F_{11}, \ldots, F_{NN} $ with a first-fail 
strategy splitting the domain of the selected variable and trying 
the lower half first.

         in

         end)matrix;
        (* rows *)

        FD.branch(space,matrixv,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_SPLIT_MIN);
        {matrix}  
    end
\end{myverbatim}

With the Explorer you can find out that for N = 3 
there is exactly one magic square satisfying the ordering 
constraints of our model. Without the ordering constraints 
there are 8 different solutions. Omitting the propagator for 
the redundant constraint will increase the search tree by one 
order of magnitude.

\section{Reified Constraints}
In this section we will see a new class of constraints called 
\emph{reified constraints}. \emph{Reified constraints} make it possible to 
express constraints involving logical connectives such as 
disjunction, implication, and negation. Reified constraints 
also make it possible to solve overconstrained problems, 
for which only some of the stated constraints can be satisfied. 

\subsection{Getting Started}
\subsubsection{Reification of a constraint}
The \emph{reification of a constraint} C with respect to a variable
x is the constraint 
\begin{quote}
( C $ \leftrightarrow $ x = 1) $ \wedge $ x $\in $ 0$\#$1
\end{quote}
where it is assumed that x does not occur free in C.

The operational semantics of a propagator for the reification of a
constraint C with respect to x is given by the following rules:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item
If the constraint store entails x = 1, the propagator for the 
reification reduces to a propagator for C.
\item
If the constraint store entails x = 0, the propagator for the 
reification reduces to a propagator for $\urcorner$ C.
\item
If a propagator for C would realize that the constraint store entails 
C, the propagator for the reification tells x = 1 and ceases to exist.
\item
If a propagator for C would realize that the constraint store is 
inconsistent with C, the propagator for the reification tells x = 0  
and ceases to exist.
\end{enumerate}
To understand these rules, you need to be familiar with the definitions 
in Section \ref{section2-2}. 

\subsubsection{0/1-variables}
A \emph{0/1-variable} is a variable that is constrained to the finite 
domain 0$\#$1. The control variables of reified constraints are 0/1-variables. 

\subsubsection{Posting reified constraints}
Here are examples for statements creating propagators for 
reified constraints: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Reified.intvar (s, dom, b)\\
Returns an FD variable freshly created in s. Also, a propagator 
is created to ensure b is true if and only if the intvar returned is in dom.
\item 
Reified.intvarVec (s, n, dom, b)\\
Returns a vector of FD variables freshly created in s. Also, a 
propagator is created to ensure b is true if and only if all the 
intvars returned are in dom. 
\item
Reified.dom (s, x, dom, b)\\
Creates a propagator in s to ensure b is true if and only if x is in dom. 
\item
Reified.rel (s, x, rel, y, b),Reified.relI (s, x, rel, n, b)\\
Creates a propagator in s to ensure b is true if and only if x 
is in rel with y (or n). 
\item
Reified.linear (s, v, rel, n, b, level)\\
Creates a propagator in s to ensure b is true if and only 
if the regular linear constraint holds for the arguments. 
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\subsection{Example: Aligning for a Photo}
\label{sec8-2}
We will now see an overconstrained problem for which it is impossible 
to satisfy all constraints. The problem specification will distinguish 
between primary and secondary constraints, and the goal is to find a 
solution that satisfies all primary constraints and as many of the 
secondary constraints as possible.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Betty, Chris, Donald, Fred, Gary, Mary, and Paul want to align in one 
row for taking a photo. Some of them have preferences next to whom they 
want to stand:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Betty wants to stand next to Gary and Mary.
\item
Chris wants to stand next to Betty and Gary.
\item   
Fred wants to stand next to Mary and Donald.
\item
Paul wants to stand next to Fred and Donald.
\end{enumerate}
Obviously, it is impossible to satisfy all preferences. Can you find 
an alignment that maximizes the number of satisfied preferences?

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
The model has a variable $ pers[p] $ for every person, where $ pers[p]$ stands 
for the position i takes in the alignment. Since there are exactly 7 
persons, we have $ pers[p] \in $ 1 $\#$ 7 for every person p. Moreover, we 
have $pers[p] \neq pers[q] $ for every pair p,q of distinct persons. The model 
has a variable $ S_i \in$ 0 $\# $ 1 for each of the 8 preferences, where 
$S_i$ = 1 if and only if the i-th preference is satisfied. To express 
this constraint, we constrain the control variable S of a preference 
``person p wants to stand next to person q'' by means of the reified 
constraint
\begin{quote}
    $(|pers[p] - pers[q]| = 1 \leftrightarrow  S = 1) \land  S \in 0\# 1$
\end{quote}
Finally, there is a variable
\begin{quote}
    \emph{Satisfaction} = $S_1 $ + $\ldots$ + $S_8$
\end{quote}
denoting the number of satisfied preferences. We want to find a solution 
that maximizes the value of \emph{Satisfaction}.

The experienced constraint programmer will note that we can eliminate a 
symmetry by picking two persons p and q and imposing the order constraint 
\begin{quote}
 $pers[p]$ $ <  $ $pers[q] $
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
To maximize \emph{Satisfaction}, we employ a two-dimensional branching 
strategy, which first branches on \emph{Satisfaction}, trying the values 
8,7,$ \ldots $ ,1 in this order. Once \emph{Satisfaction} is determined, we 
branch on the variables $pers$ using a first-fail strategy that splits 
the domain of the selected variable.

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Photo Puzzle},
label=listing 17,frame=trbl}

       val pers as #[b,c,d,f,g,m,p]= FD.rangeVec(space,7,(1,7))

       val satisfaction = FD.range(space,(0,8))

       fun satisfy(sp,constr,bools)= Vector.app(fn ((x,y),z) =>
              let
                  val tmp1 = FD.boolvar sp
                  val tmp2 = FD.boolvar sp
              in
                 (FD.Reified.linear(sp,#[(1,x),(~1,y)],
                                    FD.EQ,1,tmp1,FD.DEF);
                  FD.Reified.linear(sp,#[(1,x),(~1,y)],
                                    FD.EQ,~1,tmp2,FD.DEF);
                  FD.disjV(sp,#[tmp2,tmp1],z))
              end)
                 (VectorPair.zip(constr,bools))
   in
       FD.distinct(space,pers,FD.DOM);
       satisfy(space,constraints,si);
       let 
           val si' = Vector.map(fn x => (FD.boolvar2intvar x))si
       in
           post(space,SUMV(si') `= FD(satisfaction),FD.DOM)
       end;
       FD.rel(space,f,FD.LE,b);
       FD.branch(space,#[satisfaction],FD.B_NONE,FD.B_MAX);
       FD.branch(space,pers,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_SPLIT_MIN);
      {Betty = b, Chris = c, Donald = d, Fred = f,
       Gary = g, Mary = m, Paul = p,satisfaction}  
  end
\end{myverbatim}

The statement Explorer.exploreOne(photo) will run the script 
until a first solution is found. The first solution satisfies 
6 preferences and looks as follows:
\begin{quote}
\{Betty = intvar\{$|$5 $|$\}, 
 Chris = intvar\{$|$6 $|$\}, \\
 Donald = intvar\{$|$1 $|$\}, 
 Fred = intvar\{$|$3 $|$\}, \\
 Gary = intvar\{$|$7 $|$\}, 
 Mary = intvar\{$|$4 $|$\}, \\
 Paul = intvar\{$|$2 $|$\}, 
 satisfaction = intvar\{$|$6 $|$\}\}

\end{quote}
By construction of the script, this is the maximal number of 
preferences that can be satisfied simultaneously. 


\newpage
\subsection{Example: Self-referential Aptitude Test}
This example illustrates three issues: expressing complex 
propositional formulas as reified constraints, improving 
performance and presentation by elimination of common subconstraints, 
and using the symbolic constraint posted by \emph{FD.element}.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The self-referential aptitude test (which is taken from \cite{10}) 
consists of 10 multiple choice questions, referred to as 1 to 10. 
Each question allows for 5 possible answers, referred to as a to e. 
For each of the 50 possible answers, a condition is specified. 
For each question, exactly one of the conditions associated with 
its possible answers must hold. A solution of the test is a function 
assigning to every question a letter such that the condition selected 
by the assigned letter holds.

Here are the questions and their possible answers:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The first question whose answer is b is question 
(a) 2; (b) 3; (c) 4; (d) 5; (e) 6.
\item
The only two consecutive questions with identical answers are questions 
(a) 2 and 3; (b) 3 and 4; (c) 4 and 5; (d) 5 and 6; (e) 6 and 7.
\item
The answer to this question is the same as the answer to question 
(a) 1; (b) 2; (c) 4; (d) 7; (e) 6.
\item
The number of questions with the answer a is (a) 0; (b) 1; (c) 2; (d) 3; (e) 4.
\item
The answer to this question is the same as the answer to question 
(a) 10; (b) 9; (c) 8; (d) 7; (e) 6.
\item
The number of questions with answer a equals the number of questions 
with answer (a) b; (b) c; (c) d; (d) e; (e) none of the above.
\item
Alphabetically, the answer to this question and the answer to the 
following question are (a) 4 apart; (b) 3 apart; (c) 2 apart; 
(d) 1 apart; (e) the same.
\item
The number of questions whose answers are vowels is (a) 2; (b) 3; 
(c) 4; (d) 5; (e) 6.
\item
The number of questions whose answer is a consonant is (a) a prime; 
(b) a factorial; (c) a square; (d) a cube; (e) divisible by 5.
\item
The answer to this question is (a) a; (b) b; (c) c; (d) d; (e) e.
\end{itemize}
To understand the test, verify that
\begin{quote}
1:c  \hspace{2mm} 2:d \hspace{2mm} 3:e \hspace{2mm} 4:b \hspace{2mm}5:e\\
6:e \hspace{2mm} 7:d \hspace{2mm} 8:c \hspace{2mm} 9:b \hspace{2mm} 10:a
\end{quote}
is a correct set of answers for the test. In particular, convince 
yourself that for every question the remaining 4 possibilities to 
answer it are falsified. The script we are going to write will 
prove that there is no other set of correct answers.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
Our model has 0/1 - variables $A_i, B_i, C_i, and D_i$ for i$\in$ 1$\#$ 10 
such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$A_i + B_i + C_i + D_i + E_i = 1$
\item
$A_i$ = 1 iff the answer to Question i is a
\item
$B_i$ = 1 iff the answer to Question i is b
\item
$C_i$ = 1 iff the answer to Question i is c
\item
$D_i$ = 1 iff the answer to Question i is d
\item
$E_i$ = 1 iff the answer to Question i is e
\end{enumerate}
To obtain a compact representation of the questions, 
we also have variables $Q_i \in $ 1$\#$ 5 for i$\in$ 1 $\#$ 10 such that
\begin{quote}
$Q_i$ = 1 $\leftrightarrow A_i$ = 1\\
$Q_i$ = 2 $\leftrightarrow B_i$ = 1\\
$Q_i$ = 3 $\leftrightarrow C_i$ = 1\\
$Q_i$ = 4 $\leftrightarrow D_i$ = 1\\
$Q_i$ = 5 $\leftrightarrow E_i$ = 1
\end{quote}
The first question can now be expressed by means of five equivalences:
\begin{quote}
$ A_1 = B_2$ \\
$B_1 = (B_3\land (B_2=0))$ \\ 
$C_1 = (B_4\land (B_2+B_3=0))$\\ 
$D_1 = (B_5\land (B_2+B_3+B_4=0))$\\ 
$E_1 = (B_6\land (B_2+B_3+B_4+B_5=0))$
\end{quote}
These equivalences can be expressed by reifying the 
nested equality constraints.

The second question can be expressed with the following constraints:
\begin{quote}
$Q_1\neq Q_2,\quad Q_7\neq Q_8,$
$\quad Q_8\neq Q_9,\quad Q_9\neq Q_10$ \\ 
$A_2=(Q_2=Q_3),\quad B_2=(Q_3=Q_4),\quad C_2=(Q_4=Q_5)$ \\ 
$D_2=(Q_5=Q_6),\quad E_2=(Q_6=Q_7) $
\end{quote}

The third question can be expressed as follows:
\begin{quote} 
$ A_3=(Q_1=Q_3),\quad B_3=(Q_2=Q_3),\quad C_3=(Q_4=Q_3)$\\ 
$ D_3=(Q_7=Q_3),\quad E_3=(Q_6=Q_3)$ 
\end{quote}

The fourth question can be elegantly expressed with the constraint
\begin{quote}
    \emph{element}($Q_4$,(0,1,2,3,4)) = $\sum_{i=1}^{10}{A_i}$
\end{quote}
where the function \emph{element}(k,x) yields the k-th component 
of the tuple x.

We choose this formulation since Alice provides a propagator 
\emph{FD.element} 
for the constraint \emph{element}(k,x)= y.

\subsubsection{Reified Membership Constraints}
The nineth question can be expressed with the following equations
\begin{quote}
$ S = \sum_{i=1}^{10}{(B_i+C_i+D_i)} $\\
$A_9 = (S\in\{2,3,5,7\}) $\\ 
$B_9 = (S\in\{1,2,6\}) $\\ 
$C_9 = (S\in\{0,1,4,9\}) $\\
$ D_9 = (S\in\{0,1,8\}) $\\ 
$E_9 = (S\in\{0,5,10\}) $
\end{quote}
where S is an existentially quantified auxiliary variable. 
This time we use reified membership constraints of the form x$\in$ D.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
We branch on the variables $Q_1,Q_2,\ldots$ using the standard first-fail strategy.

\subsection{Example: Bin Packing}
\label{sec8-4}
This example features a nontrivial model involving reified 
constraints and nontrivial defined constraints. 

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Given a supply of components and bins of different types, 
compile a packing lists such that a minimal number of bins 
is used and given constraints on the contents of bins are satisfied.

In our example, there are 3 types of bins and 5 types of components. 
The bin types are red, blue, and green. The component types are 
glass, plastic, steel, wood, and copper.

The following constraints must hold for the contents of bins:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Capacity constraints:
\begin{enumerate}       
\item
Red bins can take at most 3 components, and at most 1 component of type wood.
\item
Blue bins can take exactly 1 component.
\item
Green bins can take at most 4 components, and at most 2 components of type wood.
\end{enumerate}
\item
Containment constraints (what can go into what):
\begin{enumerate}       
\item    
Red bins can contain glass, wood, and copper.
\item        
Blue bins can contain glass, steel, and copper.
\item        
Green bins can contain plastic, wood, and copper.
\end{enumerate}
\item
Requirement and exclusion constraints applying to all bin types:
\begin{enumerate}    
\item         
Wood requires plastic.
\item       
Glass excludes copper.
\item          
Copper excludes plastic.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Compile a packing list for an order consisting of 1 glass component, 
2 plastic components, 1 steel component, 3 wood components, and 2 
copper components. The packing list should require as few bins as possible.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
One possibility for a model consists in having a variable for every 
component saying in which bin the component should be packed. The 
resulting model admits many symmetric solutions and does not lead 
to a satisfactory script.

We will use a model that has both variables for bins and for
components. The model has a variable \emph{mcap} saying how many 
bins are used to pack the order. For every i $\in$ 1 $\#$
\emph{mcap} we have 6 variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\emph{btype}_i$ denoting the type of the i-th bin.
\item
$\emph{glass}_i$ denoting the number of glass components to be packed into the i-th bin.
\item
$\emph{plastic}_i $denoting the number of plastic components to be packed into the i-th bin.
\item
$\emph{steel}_i $ denoting the number of steel components to be packed into the i-th bin.
\item
$\emph{wood}_i $ denoting the number of wood components to be packed into the i-th bin.
\item
$\emph{copper}_i $ denoting the number of copper components to be packed into the i-th bin.
\end{itemize}
Given these variables, the capacity and containment constraints 
are easy to express. The requirement and exclusion constraints are 
implications that can be expressed by means of reified constraints.

To reduce the size of the search tree, we exclude some of the symmetries 
in a packing list. We require that blue bins appear before red bins, 
and red bins appear before green bins. Moreover, if two consecutive 
bins have the same type, the first bin must contain at least as many 
glass components as the second bin.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
 
We branch on the type and capacity variables with
the standard first - fail strategy. Because we want to get a 
packlist with a minimal number of bins used, you should first
branch over the variable \emph{mcap} and try smaller values
first. Here, this is not possible because the vaue is used
to create the lenght of the packing list and so has to be an
integer value. To get this value of \emph{mcap} you would need to
\emph{reflect} it's value during search. This is not possible!

We solve this problem with a test function, that uses the structure
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{Search}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/search.html} and
in a loop that tries smaller values for \emph{mcap} first and
stops when the first solution is found.

\subsubsection{Script}
The first defined constraint \emph{impl} is used to post
the following constraint:
\begin{quote}
$ v_1 \hspace{2mm} rel \hspace{2mm} v_1' \leftrightarrow v_2 \hspace{2mm} rel \hspace{2mm} v_2' $
\end{quote}
The function \emph{makebin} creates a consistently packed
bin with type
\emph{btype} and its components. It implements all the capacity, 
containment, requirement, and exclusion constraints of the problem 
specification.

The function \emph{makepacklist} imposes constraints saying that 
\emph{packlist} is a consistent packing list ordered as specified 
in the description of the model.

\emph{Match} imposes constraints saying that the packing list 
\emph{packlist} matches the order \emph{order}.

\section{Branch and Bound}
In this chapter we focus on computing an optimal solution 
according to a given cost function. While we have searched 
for optimal solutions already in Section \ref{sec8-2} and Section 
\ref{sec8-4}, we have used a rather ad-hoc strategy there. This strategy 
lacks generality and does not provide either for a proof of optimality.

In this chapter we introduce a general schema to compute an optimal 
solution according to an arbitrary cost function and show how it is 
available in Alice. This schema is called \textbf{branch and bound} and is available 
by procedures like \emph{ExploreBest}. A typical application of \emph{ExploreBest}
for a script \emph{Script} looks like
\begin{quote}
    Explorer.exploreBest Script 
\end{quote}
The branch and bound schema works as follows. When a solution of 
Script is found, all the remaining alternatives in the search tree 
are constrained to be better with respect to an order available through 
the procedure \emph{Order}. Usually Order applies a cost function to its 
arguments and creates a propagator imposing the ordering. \db{The second 
argument of Order is the previous solution, and the first argument 
is an alternative solution we are searching for.} 




\subsection{Example: Aligning for a Photo, Revisited}
In Section \ref{sec8-2} we have searched for a solution of the 
alignment problem which satisfies the maximal number of preferences. 
To this aim we have introduced a variable which counts the number of 
satisfied preferences. By branching this variable with its maximal 
value first, we have guaranteed that the first solution found is 
indeed the optimal one.

In this section we replace this ad-hoc approach by branch and bound. 
We first restate the script for the problem by omitting the branching 
code for the variable summing up the satisfied preferences. The resulting 
script is shown in Listing \ref{listing 20}.

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{The revised script for the Photo Puzzle},
label=listing 20,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun revisedphoto space =
    let 
        val pers as #[b,c,d,f,g,m,p]= 
                      FD.rangeVec(space,7,(1,7))
       (* si as a vector of boolean variables where s_i is 1 
          if the i-th preference is satisfied *)
        val si as #[s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8] = 
                           FD.boolvarVec(space,8)
       (* constraints is a vector of pairs (x,y) such that x wants to
          stand next to y *)
        val constraints = #[(b,g),(b,m),(c,b),(c,g),
                            (f,m),(f,d),(p,f),(p,d)]
       (* satisfaction is the sum of all s_i *)
        val satisfaction = FD.range(space,(0,8))
       (* satisfy posts the reified constraints:|x-y| = 1 <-> z *)
        fun satisfy(sp,constr,bools)= 
            Vector.app(fn ((x,y),z) => 
              let
                 val tmp1 = FD.boolvar sp
                 val tmp2 = FD.boolvar sp
              in
                (FD.Reified.linear(sp,#[(1,x),(~1,y)],FD.EQ,1,
                                      tmp1,FD.DEF);
                 FD.Reified.linear(sp,#[(1,x),(~1,y)],FD.EQ,~1,
                                      tmp2,FD.DEF);
                 FD.disjV(sp,#[tmp2,tmp1],z))
              end)
                 (VectorPair.zip(constr,bools))
       (* photoorder ensures that the overall sum of satisfied
          preferences in an alternative solution must be strictly 
          greater than the corresponding sum in a previous solution *)
        fun photoorder(current,last)=
            post (current, FD(satisfaction) `> 
                  `(FD.Reflect.value(last,satisfaction)),FD.BND)                   
    in
        FD.distinct(space,pers,FD.DOM);
        satisfy(space,constraints,si);
        let 
           val si' = Vector.map(fn x => (FD.boolvar2intvar x))si
        in
           post(space,SUMV(si') `= FD(satisfaction),FD.DOM)
        end;
        FD.rel(space,f,FD.LE,b);
           
        FD.branch(space,pers,FD.B_SIZE_MIN,FD.B_SPLIT_MIN);
      ({Betty = b, Chris = c, Donald = d, Fred = f,
       Gary = g, Mary = m, Paul = p,satisfaction},photoorder)
   end
\end{myverbatim}


Next we define an ordering procedure which states that the overall 
sum of satisfied preferences in an alternative solution must be 
strictly greater than the corresponding sum in a previous solution:

\lstset{caption = \textbf{ordering procedure},label=listing 21,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun photoorder(current,last)=
               post (current, FD(satisfaction)`> 
            `(FD.Reflect.value(last,satisfaction)),FD.BND)
\end{myverbatim}


Here the procedure \emph{FD.Reflect.value} from the
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{FD.Reflect}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/fd.html}
library structure is used.
It returns the value \emph{satisfaction} takes in the space \emph{last} and
throws \emph{NotAssigned} if \emph{satisfaction} is not determined.

The optimal solution can be found with the statement
\begin{quote}
    Explorer.exploreBest revisedphoto
\end{quote}
Note that the type of the script has changed to:
\lstset{caption = \textbf{type of revised photo script},
label=listing 22,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
FD.space ->
      {Betty : FD.intvar, Chris : FD.intvar, Donald : FD.intvar,
       Fred : FD.intvar, Gary : FD.intvar, Mary : FD.intvar, Paul : FD.intvar,
       satisfaction : FD.intvar} * (Modeling.space * FD.space -> unit)
\end{myverbatim}


We obtain the same solution as in \ref{sec8-2}. But now only 319 choice nodes 
are needed to find the optimal solution whereas 477 choice nodes 
were needed in Section \ref{sec8-2}. Furthermore, branch and bound allows 
us to prove in an efficient way that the last solution found is 
really the optimal one. The full search tree (including the proof 
of optimality) contains 639 choice nodes. If we inspect 
the solutions, we observe that the first solution satisfies only a 
single preference. By imposition of the ordering procedure by the 
search engine, the next found solution must satisfy more preferences. 
Indeed, the second solution satisfies two preferences. Following 
this approach we finally arrive at the optimal solution with six 
satisfied preferences.

\subsection{Example: Send Most Money}
In section \ref{distribstrat} we searched for a solution to the
Send More Money problem. The send Send Most Money problem
has more than one solution and we want to find the best one.

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A script for the Send Most Money Puzzle},
label=listing 23,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun smm space =
  let
    (* I use o' because o is an operator *)
    val letters as #[s, e, n, d, m,o', t, y] = 
        FD.rangeVec(space, 8,(0,9))
    val money = FD.range(space,(0, 98765))
    (* better function *)
    fun better (current, lastSolution) =
         post (current, FD(money) `> 
          `(FD.Reflect.value(lastSolution,money)),FD.BND)
  in
    FD.distinct (space, letters, FD.DOM);
    post (space, FD(s) `<> `0, FD.DOM);
    post (space, FD(m) `<> `0, FD.DOM);
    post (space, `1000 `* FD(s) `+ `100 `* FD(e) `+ 
                 `10 `* FD(n) `+ FD(d) `+  `1000 `* FD(m)`+ 
                 `100 `* FD(o') `+ `10 `* FD(s) `+ FD(t)
             `= `10000 `* FD(m) `+ `1000 `* FD(o') `+ `100 `* 
                  FD(n) `+ `10 `* FD(e) `+ FD(y), FD.DOM);
    post (space, FD(money)`= `10000 `* FD(m) `+ `1000 `* FD(o')
            `+ `100 `* FD(n) `+ `10 `* FD(e) `+ FD(y), FD.DOM);
    FD.branch (space, letters, FD.B_SIZE_MIN, FD.B_MIN);
    ({s, e, n, d, m, o', t, y}, better)
  end
  
\end{myverbatim}

The procedure \emph{better} in listing \ref{listing 23} ensures
that the value of \emph{money} is maximized. Again, you use
\begin{quote}
Explorer.exploreBest(smm)
\end{quote}
to get a search tree where the value of \emph{money} in every 
solution space is higher than the one in a solution space before.

\subsection{Example: Locating Warehouses}
This example features branch and bound to compute an optimal solution, 
a non-trivial branching strategy and symbolic constraints.

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Assume a company which wants to construct warehouses to supply 
stores with goods. Each warehouse to be constructed would have 
a certain capacity defining the largest number of stores which 
can be supplied by this warehouse. For the construction of a 
warehouse we have fixed costs. The costs for transportation from 
a warehouse to a store vary depending on the location of the warehouse 
and the supplied store. The aim is to determine which warehouses 
should be constructed and which stores should be supplied by the 
constructed warehouses such that the overall costs are minimized.

We assume the fixed costs of building a warehouse to be 50. We 
furthermore assume 5 warehouses W1 through W5 and 10 stores Store 1 
through Store 10. The capacities of the warehouses are:

\label{cap}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c||}
\hline
& \textbf{W1} & \textbf{W2} & \textbf{W3} & \textbf{W4} &\textbf{W5}\\
\hline
capacity  & 1 & 4 & 2 &1 & 3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The costs to supply a store by a warehouse are:

\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c||}
\hline
& \textbf{W1} & \textbf{W2} & \textbf{W3} & \textbf{W4} &\textbf{W5}\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 1}& 36 & 42 & 22 & 44 & 52\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 2}& 49 & 47 & 134 & 135 & 121\\ 
\hline
\textbf{Store 3}& 121 & 158 & 117 & 156 & 115\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 4}& 8 & 91 & 120 & 113 & 101\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 5}& 77 & 156 & 98 & 135 & 11\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 6}& 71 & 39 & 50 & 110 & 98\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 7}& 6 & 12 & 120 & 98 & 93\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 8}& 20 & 120 & 25 & 72 & 156\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 9}& 151 & 60 & 104 & 139 & 77\\
\hline
\textbf{Store 10}& 79 & 107 & 91 & 117 & 154\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
We assume that the costs are given in the matrix \emph{CostMatrix} 
defined above. For the model of this problem we introduce the 
following variables.
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\emph{Open}_i$, 1 $\leq$ i$ \leq$ 5, with domain 0$\#$1 such that 
$\emph{Open}_i$ = 1 if warehouse $W_i$ does supply at least one store.
\item
$\emph{Supplier}_i$, 1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ 10, with domain 1$\#$5 such that 
$\emph{Supplier}_i$ = j if store $\Store_i$ is supplied by 
warehouse $W_j$.
\item
$\emph{Cost}_i$, 1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ 10, such that the domain of $\emph{Cost}_i$ 
is defined by the row $\emph{CostMatrix}_i$. The variable $\emph{Cost}_i$ 
denotes the costs of supplying store $\Store_i$ by warehouse 
$W_{\emph{Supplier}_i}$, i. e., $\emph{Cost}_i$ = $\emph{CostMatrix}_{i,\emph{Supplier}_i}$.
\end{itemize}
We have the additional constraint that the capacity of the warehouses 
must not be exceeded. To this aim we introduce auxiliary variables 
$\emph{Supplies}_{i,j}$ with the domain 0$\#$1 as follows:
\begin{quote}
$\forall i \in \{1,\ldots,5\} \forall j \in \{1,\ldots, 10\}$:
$(\emph{Supplies}_{i,j} = 1) \Leftrightarrow (\emph{Supplier}_j = i)$
\end{quote}

The capacity constraints can then be stated with
\begin{quote}
$\forall i \in \{1, \ldots, 5\}:\ \emph{Cap}_i \geq $
$\sum\limits_{j=1}^{10}\emph{Supplies}_{i,j}$
\end{quote}
where $\emph{Cap}_i$ is defined defined above\ref{cap}.


\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
There are several possibilities to define a branching 
strategy for this problem.

We choose to determine the variables $\emph{Cost}_i$ by branching. 
Because no entry in a row of the cost matrix occurs twice, we 
immediately know which store is supplied by which warehouse. 
We select the variable $\emph{Cost}_i$ first for which the difference 
between the smallest possible value and the next higher value 
is maximal. Thus, decisions are made early in the search tree 
where the difference between two costs by different suppliers 
are maximal. The branching strategy will try the minimal 
value in the domain of $\emph{Cost}_i$ first. In Operations 
Research this strategy is known as the principle of \emph{least regret}.

\section{Problem Solving with Finite Set Constraints}
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Set Values}
Alice provides finite sets of integers as 
first-class values and every set value is a subset of 
the universal set \emph{U} = \{\emph{- sup},$\ldots$,\emph{sup}\}. 
The value of \emph{sup} is determined by the 
actual implementation and in Alice it is 536870910.


\subsubsection{Set Constraints}
A basic set constraint approximates a set value \emph{S} 
in three different ways: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
Constraining the lower bound by set \emph{s}:\emph{s}$\subseteq$\emph{S}. 
The lower bound contains all elements that are at 
least contained in the set value. 
\item
Constraining the upper bound by set \emph{s} :\emph{S}$\subseteq$\emph{s} . 
The upper bound contains all elements that 
are at most contained in the set value. 
\item
Constraining the cardinality of a set by a finite 
domain interval \{\emph{n},$\ldots$,\emph{m}\}: \emph{n}$\le$ $\#$\emph{S}$\le$\emph{m} . 
The cardinality constraint determines the minimal 
and maximal number of elements allowed to be contained in the set. 
\end{itemize}

A set constraint denotes a set value if either the lower 
is equal to the upper bound, the cardinality of the lower 
bound is equal to the upper bound of the cardinality constraints, 
or the cardinality of the upper bound is equal to the lower 
bound of the cardinality constraint.

Non-basic set constraints, as intersubsection $\cap$, union $\cup$, 
disjointness $\parallel$, 
and the like, are provided as propagators. For details on the provided 
set propagators see the structure
\htmladdnormallink{\textcolor{blue}{FS}}
{http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/manual/library/fs.html}.


\subsubsection{Set Constraint Propagation}
To explain constraint propagation, assume the basic 
set constraints: 
\begin{quote}
$\emptyset \subseteq$ X,Y $\subseteq$\{1,$\ldots$,5\}
\end{quote}
and additionally the following non-basic constraints:  
\begin{quote}
X $\cup$ Y = \{1,$\ldots$,5\} and X$\parallel$Y.
\end{quote}
Adding the constraints 1 $\in$ X and 2 $\notin$ Y  yields 
the intermediate store \{1\} $\subseteq$ X $\subseteq$ \{1,$\ldots$,5\}
and $\emptyset \subseteq$ Y $\subseteq$ \{1,3,4,5\}. The 
present non-basic constraints can add even more basic 
constraints: the disjointness constraint removes 1 from 
the upper bound of \emph{Y} since 1 was added to the lower bound 
of \emph{X}. The union constraint adds 2 to the lower bound of  
\emph{X} since 2 was removed from the upper bound of \emph{Y}. 
After that, propagation has reached a fixed-point and leads to 
\{1,2\}$\subseteq$ X $\subseteq$ \{1,$\ldots$,5\} and 
$\emptyset \subseteq$ Y $\subseteq$ \{3,4,5\}. 
Bringing the cardinality constraint 3 $\le$ $\#$Y $\le$ 5  
into play determines \emph{Y} to \{3,4,5\} since the upper 
bound has exactly 3 elements which is the minimal number 
required by the cardinality constraint. 
The disjointness constraint then removes 3, 4, 5 from \emph{X}'s 
upper bound and that way determines \emph{x} to \{1,2\}. 

\subsubsection{Connecting Finite Sets and Finite Domains}
Set constraints on their own are of limited use, connecting 
them with finite domain constraints provides much more 
expressivity. The straightforward way is to connect a finite 
set variable via the cardinality constraint to a finite 
domain variable. Another technique is to provide reified 
versions for various set constraints as containment and 
the like. But there are further possiblies if the fact 
that the elements of a set are integers is exploited. 


\subsubsection{Branching}
Due to the fact that constraint propagation is incomplete, 
expectedly in case of set constraints as well, solving a 
problem involving set constraints requires branching. 
\db{A typical choice-point branching a set variable is 
n $ \in $ S  $ \vee $ n $ \not\in $ S. 
The following figure illustrates that.}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\centerline{\includegraphics*[scale=0.8]{figs/setdistribution.eps}}
\caption{\textbf{Branching with set constraints}}

\end{figure}





\newpage
\subsection{The Steiner Problem}
\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
The ternary Steiner problem of order $n$ asks for $n( n - 1 ) / 6$
sets $s_i \subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with cardinality 3 such that every
two of them share at most one element. The mathematical properties of
the problem require that $n \mod 6$ has to be either 1 or 3
\cite{11}.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
We create a list \textbf{ss} of \emph{n( n - 1 ) / 6} set variables 
and constrain every set to have a cardinality of 3 and to have an 
upper bound of \emph{\{1,$\ldots$,n\}}. Further we require that the cardinality 
of the intersubsection of every two distinct sets in \emph{ss} must 
not exceed 1. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
Branching simply takes the sets as they occur in \emph{ss} 
and adds resp. removes elements from them starting from 
the smallest element. 

\subsubsection{Script}
First, the list ss is created and its elements' upper bounds 
and cardinalities are appropriately constrained. 
The procedure \emph{intersect} ensures
that every two sets share at most one element by stating that 
the cardinality of the intersubsection of two sets is in \emph{\{0,1\}}. 
Branching is straightforward and uses the provided library 
procedure \emph{setvarbranch}.

\subsubsection{Improving the Model}
A promising way to improve the efficiency of a constraint
 model (where the corresponding problem does not have a 
unique solution) is to break symmetries and thus to improve 
constraint propagation. Breaking symmetries can be achieved 
by imposing an order, in our case, an order on the set variables 
in Ss. We can simply interpret every set as a number with 
three digits to the base \emph{(n + 1)}. A set with three elements 
\{\emph{$x_1, x_2, x_3$}\} can be mapped to an integer by 
\emph{(n + 1)}\emph{$^2 * x_1$} + \emph{(n + 1)}\emph{$^2 * x_2$ + $x_3$}. 

\subsubsection{Extending the Solver}
The finite set library provides 
FS.match to match 
the elements of a set \emph{s} with a fixed number of elements 
to a vector of size \emph{$\#$ s} of finite domain variables. This 
library constraint in conjunction with Map is used to 
convert the list of sets Ss to a list of finite domain 
lists with 3 finite domains per list. Finally the order 
between adjacent sets is imposed by 
\begin{quote}
N1 * N1 * $y_1$ + N1 * $y_2$ + $y_3 < $ N1 * N1 * $x_1$ + N1 * $x_2$ + $x_3$.
\end{quote}

    val n1 = n + 1

    val ivarlist = List.map(fn x => 
    let 
       val tmp = FD.rangeVec(space,3,(1,n))
     in
       (FS.match(space,x,tmp);Vector.toList tmp)
    end)(ss)
    fun redundantconstr(s,[y]) = ()
      | redundantconstr(space,y as [y1,y2,y3]::ys)= 
             (List.map(fn x as [x1,x2,x3] =>
                 post(space,`n1n1 `* FD(y1) `+ `n1 `* FD(y2) `+
                            FD(y3) `< `n1n1 `* FD(x1) `+ `n1 `* 
                            FD(x2) `+ FD(x3),FD.DOM))(ys);
              redundantconstr(space,ys))       
 in
    redundantconstr(space,ivarlist)
end;

This code is to be inserted right before the branching. 
Solving the Steiner problem of order 9 results in the following 
search tree.

We see that the number of choice nodes decreases from 
4529 to 419 and the number of failure nodes decreases from 
4505 to 359.

\subsection{Generating Hamming Codes}

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Generate a Hamming code that fits in \emph{b} - bit words to 
code \emph{n} symbols where the Hamming distance between every 
two symbol codes is at least \emph{b}. The Hamming distance between 
two words is the number of bit positions where they differ. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
A \emph{b} - bit word is modeled by a set 
\emph{s} $\subseteq$ \{1,$\ldots$,\emph{b}\}
where \emph{e}$\in$ \emph{s} means that the bit
at position \emph{e} is set (resp. unset otherwise). The Hamming 
distance \emph{h(a, b)} between two words \emph{a} and \emph{b}
represented as sets $s_a$  and $s_b$ 
can be computed by subtracting from the word size $b$ 
the number of elements that is contained 
($\#(s_a \cap s_b)$) \db{resp. is not contained 
($\#(\{1,\ldots,b\}\setminus s_a \cup s_b)$)
in both sets. Thus, the Hamming distance results in 
\begin{quote}
$h(a, b)$ = $s_b$ - $\#$ ($s_a \cap s_b $)
 - $\#$(\{1,$\ldots$,b$\backslash s_a \cup s_b$).  
\end{quote}}

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A Script for the Hamming Codes Problem},

\begin{myverbatim}

 
fun hamming bits distance numsymbols space =
    let
       val xs = List.tabulate(numsymbols,(fn x => 
                    FS.upperBound(space,#[(1,bits)])))
       val tmp = FS.Value.make(space,#[(1,bits)])
       fun minDist(x,y)= 
           let
              val tmp1 = FS.setvar space

              val tmp3 = FS.setvar space
              val tmp4 = FD.intvar(space,#[(0,bits)])

              FS.cardinality(space,tmp1,tmp4);
              FS.cardinality(space,tmp3,tmp5);
              post(space,`bits `- FD(tmp4) `- FD(tmp5) 
                         `>= `distance,FD.DOM))
           end 
       fun forallTail([y])= ()
         | forallTail(y::ys) = (List.app(fn x => 
                          minDist(y,x))(ys);forallTail ys)
    in
       forallTail(xs);
       FS.setvarbranch(space,Vector.fromList xs,
                             FS.FSB_NONE,FS.FSB_MIN);
       xs
    end
\end{myverbatim}


The Script in Listing \ref{listing 27} generates a Hamming 
code for \emph{numsymbols} symbols in words with \emph{bits} bits 
and a Hamming distance of \emph{distance}. The procedure \emph{minDist} 
implements the constraint that the Hamming distance does not 
exceed the value of \emph{distance}. The list \emph{xs} holds the sets 
representing the single codes.
The nested loop \emph{forallTail} 
imposes \emph{minDist} on all pairwise distinct elements of \emph{xs}. 
The branching employs straightforwardly a naive strategy.

The following code generates a Hamming code for 16 symbols 
using 7 bit words and ensures a Hamming distance of 2. 
\lstset{label=listing 28,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
val distance = 2
val bits = 7
val numsymbols = 16 

let 
    val(s,r) = valOf(Search.searchOne
                (hamming bits distance numsymbols))
in
    List.map(fn y => domainToList y)
     (List.map(fn x =>FS.Reflect.upperBound(s,x))r)
end

\subsection{Packing Files onto Disks}

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
Suppose, you want to copy a set of files from your hard-disk 
onto as few as possible diskettes of a given size, e. g. onto 
common 1.44 MB diskettes. In case your files do not fit on a 
single diskette, it might become quite tricky to figure out 
the minimal number of needed diskettes and how to partition the files. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
A diskette is modeled by a set $\text{disk}_i$. All sets $\text{disk}_i$  
form a partition of the set of all files $s_\text{all\_files}$, 
i. e., all $\text{disk}_i$ are pairwise disjoint and their union is 
$s_\text{all\_files}$. The sizes of all files contained in a set is 
summed up and compared with the fixed capacity of the diskette. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
The branching over the sets representing the individual disks
employs straightforwardly a naive strategy. To get the minimal
number of needed disks, we have to write a procedure that searches
for the first solution iterating over an integer variable \emph{nbDisks}
beginning with small values. \db{It is not possible to use a two dimensional
branching strategy because the value of \emph{nbDisks} would have to be
\emph{reflected} during search}.

\subsubsection{Script}
\lstset{caption = \textbf{A Script for the Packing Files Problem},

              {name= "e",size = 700},{name= "f",size = 210}]
    

fun spreadFiles (files:filev) diskCap nbDisks space =
    let
       val size = Vector.length files
       val disks = Vector.tabulate(nbDisks,fn x => 
                      FS.upperBound(space,#[(1,size)]))
       val disks' = Vector.tabulate(nbDisks,fn x => 
                      FD.boolvarVec(space,size))

             in      
                List.app(fn y => FS.domR(space,x,FS.SUP,#[(y,y)],
                           Vector.sub(Vector.sub(disks',i),y-1)))
                        list;
                FD.linear(space,VectorPair.zip(
                           Vector.tabulate(size,fn z => 
                                      #size(Vector.sub(files,z))),
                            Vector.map(fn z => FD.boolvar2intvar z)
                                 (Vector.sub(disks',i))),
                          FD.LQ,diskCap,FD.DOM)
             end)vec
   in 
       FS.relN(space,disks,FS.DUNION,all_files);
       sumFiles(disks);
       FS.setvarbranch(space,disks,FS.FSB_NONE,FS.FSB_MIN); 
       disks
   end
     
     
\end{myverbatim}


The function \emph{spreadfiles} gets the formal arguments \emph{files},
\emph{diskCap} and \emph{nbDisks}. The script returns the problem 
variable \emph{disks} that contains the set of diskettes of 
size \emph{diskCap} needed to store all files in \emph{files}. 
and specifies what files have to be stored on which diskette.

The argument \emph{files} is a vector of individual files, where each 
file is represented by a record with labels \emph{name} and \emph{size}. 
The argument \emph{diskCap} and \emph{nbDisks} are integers.

Because we want the number of disks we need to store the files
to be minimal, we have to write an additional function that checks
the result of a hardcoded value for \emph{nbDisks} and tries to find -
if possible - a smaller one.

The procedure \emph{sum\_files} ensures that every file is stored in
a disk without exceeding capacity.

In listing \ref{listing 30} is given a function \emph{test} that
gets as formal argument an integer \emph{x}. Given this integer, it
computes the result of
\begin{quote}
Search.searchOne(spreadFiles files diskCap x).
\end{quote}
If the function finds a solution it stops, otherwise it continues
computation with the successor of \emph{x}.
\lstset{caption = \textbf{Test function for the Packing 
Files Problem},
label=listing 30,frame=trbl}
\begin{myverbatim}
fun test x =                        
  let 
     val b = (Search.searchOne(spreadFiles files diskCap x))
             handle Space.InvalidSpace => NONE
     fun name l = List.map(fn z =>List.map(fn y => 
                  (#name)(Vector.sub(files,y-1)))z)l
  in
     case b of NONE => test(x+1)
             | SOME (s,r) =>
               (x,name(List.map(fn z => domainToList z)
                  (Vector.toList(Vector.map(fn x =>
                     FS.Reflect.upperBound(s,x))r))))
     
  end
\end{myverbatim}


Given the \emph{test} function the argument 0, it computes
\begin{quote}
$(2, [['a','b','f' ], ['c','d','e' ]])$
\end{quote}
where 2 is the minimal number of disks you need and
the second argument is a list with the name of the files
stored on the specific disks.

\subsection{A Crew Allocation Problem}

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
A small air-line has to assign their 20 flight attendants 
to 10 flights. Each flight has to be accompanied by a certain 
number of cabin crew (see first Table) that has to meet a couple 
of constraints. First, to serve the needs of international 
clients the cabin crew has to be able to speak German, Spanish, 
and French (see second Table). Further, a minimal number of 
stewardesses resp. stewards have to attend a flight 
(see third Table). Finally, every cabin crew member has 
two flights off after an attended flight.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
The cabin crew for every flight is represented as a set
with domain 1$\#$20. 
The constraints on cabin crews of individual flights are 
modeled in terms of constraints on the cardinality of the 
intersection of the cabin crew set of that flight with the 
sets associated with particular restrictions. Therefore 
the following subsets of the cabin crew are introduced: 
male, female, Spanish-speaking, French-speaking, and 
German-speaking cabin crew. The constraint that a crew 
member has two flights off after an attended flight is 
expressed by the disjointness of the appropriate sets 
representing a crew per flight. 

\subsubsection{Script}
The function \emph{assignCrew} returns a solver configured according 
to its arguments \emph{flights} and \emph{crew}. As previously mentioned, 
the constraints on the cabin crew of a flight are expressed in 
terms of sets of crew members meeting these constraints. For 
that reason the following variables are defined: 
\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{stewards} (male cabin crew members), 
\item
\emph{stewardesses} (female cabin crew members), 
\item
\emph{french, german, and spanish} 
(French-, German-, resp. Spanish-speaking cabin crew members). 
\end{itemize}

The procedure \emph{teamConstraint} imposes the abovementioned constraints 
on the individual flight cabin crew sets intersecting them with 
appropriate sets by \emph{FS.relOp} with the set operation \emph{FS.INTER},
and constrains the \db{intersection's cardinality according to Table 
\ref{table3}(using FS.cardinality and \emph{post})}.

The procedure \emph{sequenceDisjoint} is responsible to ensure that every 
crew member may enjoy a two-flight break between two flights. It 
is a recursive procedure imposing \emph{FS.rel} with the set operation
\emph{FS.DISJ} upon every 3 subsequent sets.

The actual solver declares the local variable \emph{crewlist} that 
contains the list of sets representing the individual crew 
assignments. Then, the constraints of the procedure \emph{teamConstraint} 
are imposed on \emph{crewlist} by the \emph{List.app} procedure, 
applying the data provided by \emph{flights} to \emph{crewlist}. 
The branching is straightforward and has no particularities.

The following sample data can be used to test the solver:

\subsection{Scheduling a Golf Tournament}

\subsubsection{Problem Specification}
There are 32 individually playing golfers who play in 
groups of 4, so-called foursomes. For every week of the 
golf tournament new sets of foursomes are to be compiled. 
The task is to assign foursomes for a given number of weeks 
such that no player plays with another player in a foursome twice. 

\subsubsection{Maximal Number of Weeks}
The upper bound for the number of weeks is 10 weeks due to 
the following argument.\db{ There are $\left({32 \atop 2}\right) $ = 496 pairing of players. 
Each foursome takes 6 pairings and every week consists of 8 
foursomes, hence, every week occupies 48 pairings. Having 
only 496 pairings available, at most $[496 / 48]$ = 10 weeks can be assigned 
without duplicating foursomes}. Unfortunately, only assignments 
for 9 weeks could be found so far. Fortunately again, 
this assignment could only be found by solvers using set 
constraints. Other approaches, using linear integer 
programming, failed for this problem size. 

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
A foursome is modeled as a set of cardinality 4. A week is 
a collection of foursomes and all foursomes of a week are 
pairwise disjoint and their union is the set of all golfers. 
This leads to a partition constraint. Further, each foursome 
shares at most one element with any other foursome, since 
a golfer, of course, may occur in different foursomes but 
only on his own. Therefore, the cardinality of the intersubsection 
of a foursome with any other foursome of the other weeks 
has to be either 0 or 1. 

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
The branching strategy is crucial for this problem.
A player is taken and assigned to all possible foursomes. 
Then the next player is taken and assigned and so on.
The approach, coming usually into mind first, to branch
a foursome completely, fails even for smaller instances of 
the problem. This branching strategy is called \emph{MIN UNKNOWN 
ELEMENT}.

The function Golf returns a solver to find an assignment 
for \emph{NbOfFourSomes} foursomes per week and NbOfWeeks weeks 
duration. The number of players is computed from NbOfFourSomes 
and stored in NbOfPlayers. The auxiliary function \emph{flatten} is 
used to flatten a list of lists of variables.
%Its definition 
%is necessary since the library function of the same name 
%works only on ground terms. \\

The variable \emph{tournament} is a list, that contains for
every field (week) a list of sets (foursomes).

The procedure \emph{weeks} imposes the constraint that
all sets are subsets of \{1,$\ldots$,nbOfPlayers\} 
and have exactly 4 elements. Further, it imposes 
that every foursome shares at most one element with any 
other foursome of other weeks.

\subsection{Example: Sudoku Problem - Revisited}

In section \ref{sudoku-puzzle} is both given a formulation
and a solution to a Sudoku puzzle. There are also shown
two different, mutually redundant viewpoints for the problem.
In section \ref{sudoku-puzzle2} you have already seen a
realization of the first viewpoint. Now, you are presented
a realization of the second approach.

\subsubsection{Viewpoint}
\db{The variables $nb_1, \ldots, nb_9$ represent the numbers
1, $\ldots$, 9, and the domain of every number is the set
P\{1, $\ldots$, 81\}, i.e. the boxes a number occurs; an
assignment $nb_i$ = \{$c_1, \ldots, c_n $\} means that number i occurs
in box $c_1, \ldots, c_n$ and \{$c_1, \ldots, c_n $\} is a subset of 
\{1, $\ldots$, 81\}}.

Given the following tabular, initially, the lower bound of $nb_1$ is
\{ 8, 31, 43, 55\} and its upper bound is the set \{1, $\ldots$, 81\}. The variable
$nb_2$ has the lower bound \{2, 51, 63, 67\}, $nb_3$ the lower bound 
\{10, 39, 49, 59, 74\}, $nb_4$ the lower bound \{ 19, 47, 69, 79\} and 
$nb_5$ the lower bound \{ 23,29,42,53,64\} for example. Such as $nb_1$'s upper
bound, the upper bound of $nb_2, \ldots, nb_5$ is \{1, $\ldots$, 81\}.

\section{Combined Viewpoints}
As we have have learned in section \ref{redundant}, redundant
constraints can both improve the performance of a script and
decrease the size of the search tree.

In this section, you are presented an approach to use the
advantage of combining \emph{mutually redundant models}.


\subsection{Construction of a combined Model}
The idea of combining \emph{mutually redundant models} was
first introduced by  Cheng, Choi, Lee and Wu \cite{9}.
Let $V_1$ = ($X_1, D_1$) and $V_2$ = ($X_2, D_2$) two viewpoints
for the same problem. From each viewpoint a complete
model can be constructed, say $M_1$ = ($X_1, D_1, C_1$), 
$M_2$ = ($X_2, D_2, C_2$). So, they are \emph{mutually redundant}.

If you combine these two models, you get a new model 
$M_3$ = ($X_3, D_3, C_3$), where $X_3$ = $X_1 \cup X_2$, 
$D_3$ = $D_1 \cup D_2$
and $C_3$ =  $C_1 \cup C_2 \cup C_c$. $C_c$ is a set of
\emph{channeling constraints}.

You should always choose constraints that are of low arity, i.e.
that assignments in one viewpoint can be propagated in the other when
only a few variables have been assigned. 
The combination of viewpoints is useless if propagation
via channeling constraints can only occur when a complete assignment
has been made. It can also be an advantage to do a combined model
without constraints that are hard to express in one viewpoint,
provided that the constraints of the other viewpoint together
with the channeling constraints take on their work.


\subsubsection{Channeling constraints}
Channeling constraints relate the variables of two
viewpoints. Usually, they are of binary form, i.e.
they relate a single variable in one viewpoint to
a single variable in the other. If an assignment 
is made in the model constructed
from one viewpoint, it can be translated into an 
assignment in the other and vice versa.

Hence, the advantage of a combined model is the strenghtened
propagation caused by these channeling constraints. If in one
model, say $M_1$ = ($X_1, D_1, C_1$), the values from the variables
in $X_1$ are reduced by the constraints in $C_1$, \db{their removal
is propagated by the channeling constraints} to the variables of the
other model $M_2$ = ($X_2, D_2, C_2$). So, the propagated removals
from the first viewpoint together with the constraints in $C_2$ may
remove more values from the domains of $X_2$'s variables than the
constraints in $C_2$ alone.

\newpage
\subsection{Example: Sudoku Problem}
In section \ref{sudoku-puzzle2} and section \ref{sudoku-puzzle3}
you have already seen how the Sudoku Problem can be realized
in Alice. These two models - one with finite domain constraints,
the other with finite set constraints - now are put together
into one combined model.

\subsubsection{New Problem Description}
The Sudoku Problem example in section \ref{sudoku-puzzle} can
be solved without any search at all. To underline the advantages
of a combined model, we need a Problem that is harder to solve.
Below you are given a problem that is hard  and needs search to be 
solved.

\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c||}

\hline
 & 5 &  & 1 &  &  &  &  & \\
\hline   
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Viewpoint and Constraints}
The viewpoint of the new combined model consists in a set
X, the union of the problem variables of the scripts in listing
\ref{listing 11} and \ref{listing 35} with their respective
domains. Also the constraints of both models are put together.
Additionally, you have a set of channeling constraints of the
form
\begin{quote}
grid'[i] = j $\Leftrightarrow i+1 \in $ numbers[ j-1],
\end{quote}
where grid is the vector of problem variables from the first
model and numbers the vector of problem variables from the
second model. Note, that the channeling constraints are realized
with \emph{Reified Constraints} among other things.

\subsubsection{Branching Strategy}
\db{We use a strategy that the variable with the minimal
cardinality between its lower and upper bound and picks the minimal
value of the selected variable first}.
