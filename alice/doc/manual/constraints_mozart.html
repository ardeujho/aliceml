<P>Constraint-based problem solving is a technique for solving hard
combinatorial problems that can be stated as variables ranging over a finite
domain of non-negative integers, or sets thereof. Problems in this class range
from puzzles to real world applications as diverse as scheduling, ware house
allocation, configuration and placement.</P>

<P>The two basic techniques of constraint programming are <EM>constraint
propagation</EM> and <EM>constraint distribution</EM>. Constraint propagation
is an efficient inference mechanism obtained with concurrent propagators
accumulating information in a <EM>constraint store</EM>. Constraint
distribution splits a problem into complementary cases once constraint
propagation cannot advance further. By iterating propagation and distribution,
propagation will eventually determine the solutions of a problem.</P>

<P>Constraint distribution can easily lead to an exponential growth of the
number of subproblems to be considered. Fortunately, this potential
combinatorial explosion can often be contained by combining strong propagation
mechanisms with problem specific heuristics for selecting distribution
steps.</P>

<P>The Alice constraint programming features are inherited directly from <A
href="http::/www.mozart-oz.org">Mozart</A>. We refer to its <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/">Finite Domain Programming</A>
and <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fst/">Finite Set Programming</A>
tutorials for a thorough introduction.</P>


<?php subsection("introduction-example", "Example") ?>

<P>The following classic puzzle gives a first idea of the combinatorial
problems constraint programming can solve.</P>

<P>The <EM>Send More Money</EM> problem consists in finding distinct digits for
the letters <TT>S</TT>, <TT>E</TT>, <TT>N</TT>, <TT>D</TT>, <TT>M</TT>,
<TT>O</TT>, <TT>R</TT>, <TT>Y</TT> such that <TT>S</TT> and <TT>M</TT> are
different from zero (no leading zeros) and the equation</P>

<PRE class=code>
SEND + MORE = MONEY</PRE>

<P>is satisfied. The unique solution of the problem is 9567 + 1085 = 10652.</P>


<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>Alice provides most of the constraint functionality available in
<A href="http::/www.mozart-oz.org">Mozart</A>, but in a typeful way. For linear
finite domain constraints there is a convenient library abstraction that allows
for easy constraint construction and leaves the decision of choosing the best
constraint to the system.</P>

<P>The constraint programming functionality of Alice is provided through a
library interface, containing the following <A
href="components.html">components</A>:</P>

<?php section("fd", "finite domain constraints") ?>

<P><EM>Finite domains constraints</EM> describe the set of values a
non-negative integer variable may take.</P>

<P>As an example of finite domain constraint solving, consider the
<TT>SEND + MORE = MONEY</TT> problem. It may be solved in Alice by the following
program:</P>

<PRE class=code>
fun money () =
    let
	val V as #[S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y] = vec(8, [0`#9])
    in
	distinct V; 
	post (S `&lt;&gt; `0); 
	post (M `&lt;&gt; `0); 
	post (             `1000`*S `+ `100`*E `+ `10`*N `+ D `+
	                   `1000`*M `+ `100`*O `+ `10`*R `+ E `=
              `10000`*M `+ `1000`*O `+ `100`*N `+ `10`*E `+ Y ); 
	distribute (FD.FIRSTFAIL, V); 
	{S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y}
    end</PRE>

<P>Constraint problems have to be formulated as a script, a nullary function
posting the necessary constraints to the constraint store. The script makes use
of the <TT>Linear</TT> component to formulate the constraints conveniently. See
the description of the <A href="library/fd.html"><TT>FD</TT></A> and <A
href="library/linear.html"><TT>Linear</TT></A> structures for a detailed
description of the meaning of the above constraints.</P>

<P>Once written, the script can be passed to different search engines. For
example, we can search for all possible solutions, using the <A
href="library/search.html"><TT>Search</TT></A> structure:</P>

<PRE class=code>
inspect (Search.searchAll money)</PRE>

<P>Or we can search for the first solution, using the interactive
<A href="library/explorer.html">Explorer</A>:</P>

<PRE class=code>
Explorer.exploreOne money</PRE>

<P>To learn more about constraint programming with Mozart, we refer to the <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/index.html">Mozart
tutorial</A>.</P>


<?php section("fs", "finite set constraints") ?>

<P><EM>Finite set constraints</EM> describe the possible elements that can be
contained in the set denoted by a set variable.</P>

<P>Alice supports the full range of <A href="library/fs.html">finite set
constraints</A>, as available in <A
href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/fdt/">Mozart
tutorial</A>.</P>


<?php section("spaces", "spaces") ?>

<P>Like Mozart, Alice supports the unique concept of first-class
<EM>computation spaces</EM> that can be used to program inference engines for
problem solving. See the <A href="library/space.html"><TT>Space</TT></A>
component for details.</P>
