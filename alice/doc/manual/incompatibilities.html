		"incompatibilities\nwith\nSML") ?>



<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>Most Alice extensions to SML'97 are conservative. There are some
incompatibilies with SML'97 however. Most of them are quite pathological,
caught at compile time, and can easily be fixed in an SML compatible way. This
page describes known deviations and possible (backward-compatible)
workarounds.</P>

<P>Also be aware of some <A href="limitations.html">limitations</A> of the
current version of Alice, which might produce additional incompatibilities.</P>


<?php section("comments", "Comments") ?>

<P>Alice ML supports <A href="sugar.html#comments">line comments</A>, which start with the character sequence <TT>(*)</TT>. Valid SML programs that contain a closing parenthesis as the first character of a regular comment (including nested ones) will hence be parsed incorrectly.</P>

<?php subsection("comments-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>Insert white space or use any other character than <TT>)</TT>.</LI>
</UL>


<?php section("keywords", "reserved words") ?>

<P>The following are reserved words in Alice and may not be used as
identifiers:</P>

<PRE class=code>
	any       assert    assertd   constructor   exttype    fct
	finally   from      import    non           lazy       pack
	spawn     unpack    withfun   withval       _file_     _line_</PRE>

<P>The latter two are not valid SML identifiers, but would be parsed as a wildcard followed by an identifier in SML.</P>


<?php subsection("keywords-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>Avoid these as identifiers.</LI>
</UL>


<?php section("openmulti", "multiple open") ?>

<P>When <TT>open</TT> is used with multiple arguments this is taken as sugar
for multiple open declarations. This results in slightly different scoping rules, when nested structures are present.</P>

<?php subsection("openmulti-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
structure A =
struct
    structure B = struct val x = 1 end
end
structure B = struct val x = "1" end

open A B

val y = x</PRE>

<P>According to Standard ML, <TT>y</TT> should have type <TT>string</TT> because <TT>x</TT> refers to <TT>B.x</TT>. In Alice ML however, <TT>x</TT> refers to <TT>A.B.x</TT> and hence <TT>y</TT> is assigned type <TT>int</TT>.

<?php subsection("openmulti", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>Avoid multiple arguments to <TT>open</TT>.</LI>
</UL>


<?php section("openinfix", "open and infix") ?>

<P>Open pulls in <A href="modules.html#fixity">infix status</A>. Opening a
structure that</P>

<OL>
  <LI> contains infix declarations, and </LI>
  <LI> has not been constrained by a signature </LI>
</OL>

<P>will change the infix environment, while in SML it would not.</P>

<?php subsection("openinfix-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
structure S =
struct
    infix ++
    fun l1++l2 = l1 @ l2
end

open S

val l = ++([1],[2])		(* error: misplaced infix *)</PRE>


<?php subsection("openinfix-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>Use appropriate signature constraints (always a good idea anyway):

   <PRE class=code>
signature SIG =
sig
    val ++ : 'a list * 'a list -> 'a list
end

structure S : SIG =
struct
    infix ++
    fun l1++l2 = l1 @ l2
end

open S

val l = ++([1],[2])</PRE>
  </LI>

  <LI>Or insert <TT>op</TT> on every use of such identifiers:

    <PRE class=code>
val l = op++([1],[2])</PRE>
  </LI>
</UL>


<?php section("valrec", "val rec") ?>

<P>Recursive value bindings do not remove constructor status on the identifiers
bound. You cannot bind functions to an identifier that was a constructor
previously.</P>

<?php subsection("valrec-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
val rec NONE = fn x => x
fun NONE x = x</PRE>

<P>Both these declarations are legal in SML'97 due to an artefact of the
formal language specification and would introduce a function named
<TT>NONE</TT>, hiding the constructor status of <TT>NONE</TT>. In Alice, they
produces a type clash because they are interpreted as trying to match
<TT>NONE</TT> with a lambda expression.</P>

<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM> This behaviour is consistent with SML'90 as well
as several other SML implementations, and probably what the user would
expect.</P>


<?php subsection("valrec-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI> Rename your function, this is perverse anyway. </LI>
</UL>


<?php section("matching", "pattern matching") ?>

<P>Since Alice is a <A href="futures.html#spawn">concurrent</A> language, matches containing impure patterns -
particularly <TT>ref</TT> patterns - may behave slightly odd. Patterns that
are exhaustive in plain SML may not necessarily be so in Alice. Also, pattern
matching may trigger side-effects, when a <A href="futures.html#lazy">lazy
future</A> is <A href="futures.html#request">requested</A> by matching and the
corresponding computation contains effects.</P>

<?php subsection("matching-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
fun f (ref false) = 1
  | f (ref true)  = 2</PRE>

<P>The match in this declaration will be flagged as unexhaustive by the Alice
compiler. The reason is that pattern matching is not atomic, so a concurrent
thread may have altered the reference between both tests - making them both
fail! A particular example of a non-matching application is the following:</P>

<PRE class=code>
val rec r = ref (lazy (r := false; true))
f r</PRE>

<P>In this example, testing for the first clause will first dereference
<TT>r</TT> and then request the lazy future, which determines to <TT>true</TT>,
so that the clause does not match. In the meantime, the triggered computation
has set <TT>r</TT> to <TT>false</TT>, hence the consecutive test, which
dereferences <TT>r</TT> for a second time, will see <TT>false</TT> and fail
likewise.</P>

<?php subsection("matching-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI> Be careful with using <TT>ref</TT> patterns (and other potentially impure
  patterns, such as <A href="sugar.html#patterns-guard">guards</A>). If a
  reference access has to be atomic, make sure it is only matched once, or
  accessed via <TT>!</TT> in one operation.
  <P>Be aware that patterns with <TT>ref</TT> are only
  ever considered exhaustive by the compiler if the argument pattern is
  exhaustive in itself - information from different patterns for the same
  reference cannot be accumulated.</P> </LI>
</UL>


<?php section("datatypes", "datatypes") ?>

<P>Alice' <A href="types.html#structural">structural datatypes</A> come with
some restrictions that are not present in SML. In particular, Alice demands
that, whenever a datatype constructor is used in an expression, pattern, the
corresponding type is visible. Dually, if a datatype is replicated, all its
constructors must be visible.</P>


<?php subsection("datatypes-example", "Examples") ?>

<P>The following program will not type-check: </P>

<PRE class=code>
datatype t = C
type t = int
val c = C</PRE>

<P>The datatype replication in the last line of the following snippet is
invalid as well:</P>

<PRE class=code>
datatype t = C
datatype u = C | D
datatype v = datatype t</PRE>

<P>Though one does not usually write such code directly, these situations
can appear implicitly through liberal use of open.</P>


<?php subsection("datatypes-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI> Do not shadow datatypes or constructors you intend to use. </LI>
  <LI> The problem can often be avoided by using qualified names. </LI>
</UL>


<?php section("conarity", "constructor arity") ?>

<P>For <A href="interop.html">interoperability</A> reasons, Alice currently has
the concept of syntactic arity for constructors. For example, in </P>

<PRE class=code>
type     t = int * real
datatype t = A of int * real | B of {a : bool, b : string} | C of t</PRE>

<P>constructor <TT>A</TT> and <TT>B</TT> both have arity 2, while <TT>C</TT>
has arity 1. Usually, syntactic arity can be ignored. However, signature
matching is restricted to disallow changing the syntactic arity of
constructors.</P>

<P class=note><EM>Note:</EM>The same restriction is imposed by Moscow ML.</P>

<P>Note that syntactic arity is calculated after elimination of derived
forms. Therefore <TT>C</TT> has arity 3 in the following example:</P>

<PRE class=code>
datatype t = C of u
withtype u = int * int * string</PRE>


<?php subsection("conarity-example", "Examples") ?>

<P>The following program will not elaborate in the current version of Alice:</P>

<PRE class=code>
signature S1 =
sig
    datatype t = C of int * real
end

structure M1 :> S1 =	(* error: mismatch *)
sig
    type     u = int * real
    datatype t = C of u
end</PRE>

<P>Neither will:</P>

<PRE class=code>
type u = int * real

signature S2 =
sig
    datatype t = C of u
end

structure M2 :> S2 =	(* error: mismatch *)
sig
    datatype t = C of int * real
end</PRE>

<?php subsection("conarity-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>In most cases, modules can be rewritten by either expanding type
    synonyms or by introducing auxiliary type synonyms:</P>

    <PRE class=code>
structure M1 :> S1 =
sig
    type     u = int * real
    datatype t = C of int * real
end

structure M2 :> S2 =
sig
    type     u = int * real
    datatype t = C of u
end</PRE>

    <P>Transformations can get tedious in the case of higher-order functors,
    however.</P>
  </LI>
</UL>



<?php section("funid", "namespaces") ?>

<P>Alice provides <A href="modules.html#higher">higher-order functors</A>. To
integrate them smoothly into the language it was necessary to give up the
separation between namespaces for structures and those for functors - both are
modules. This may break programs that declare structures and functors with
identical names.</P>

<?php subsection("funid-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE>
functor Table() = struct (* ... *) end

structure Table  = Table()
structure Table' = Table()	(* error: Table is not a functor *)</PRE>

<?php subsection("funid-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>
      Rename your functors or structures appropriately. It is a good idea to
      stick to naming conventions that denote functors with names like
      <TT>MkTable</TT>.
    </P>
  </LI>
</UL>


<!--
<?php section("include", "include") ?>

<P>Because of syntactic ambiguity with uses of <A
href="modules.html#paramsig">parameterized signatures</A>, Alice does not
support the multiple include derived form.</P>


<?php subsection("include-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
signature S =

    include B
end</PRE>
  </LI>
</UL>

<?php section("sharing", "sharing") ?>

<P>In Alice, datatypes are not generative, but are just structural types
similar to records. This has an impact on the use of sharing constraints,
which require <I>flexible</I> (i.e. abstract) type constructors.</P>

<P>Alice relaxes the rules for sharing constraints and allows sharing of
type constructors as long as one of the following conditions holds:</P>

<OL>
  <LI> both are identical type synonyms, or </LI>
  <LI> the type constructor introduced later (lexically) is abstract. </LI>
</OL>

<P>This makes sharing between datatypes possible in most cases. There are
exceptions, however.</P>

<?php subsection("sharing-example", "Example") ?>

<PRE class=code>
signature A =
sig
    type t
end

signature B =
sig
    datatype t = C
end

signature S =
sig
    structure A : A
    structure B : B
    sharing type A.t = B.t	(* error: types incompatible *)
end</PRE>

<P>Signature <TT>S</TT> will not elaborate because type <TT>B.t</TT> is
specified after <TT>A.t</TT> and is neither abstract nor identical to
<TT>A.t</TT> (which is abstract).</P>

<?php subsection("sharing-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>Signature <TT>S</TT> can be made valid by reordering structure
    specifications:</P>

    <PRE class=code>
signature S =
sig
    structure B : B
    structure A : A
    sharing type A.t = B.t
end</PRE>

    <P>Suitable reordering is not always possible, however.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>In general, we consider sharing constraints an obsolete feature of SML.
    Use <TT>where</TT> constraints instead<!-- (Alice as well as SML/NJ
    support <TT>where</TT> constraints for whole structures)-->.</P>
  </LI>
</UL>


<?php section("library", "extended library") ?>

<P>Alice extends many of the structures and signatures defined by the <A
href="http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">Standard ML Basis Library</A>. This may
change the meaning of programs that open library structures, or use library
signatures.</P>

<?php subsection("library-example", "Examples") ?>

<P>In the following snippet, the referenced function <TT>equal</TT> will be
shadowed by the <TT>open</TT> declaration:</TT>

<PRE class=code>
fun equal (a : 'a -> 'b, b : 'a -> 'b) = true
open Int
val b = equal (op+, op-)	(* error: type mismatch *)</PRE>

<?php subsection("library-fix", "Workaround") ?>

<UL>
  <LI> Avoid opening library structures that might shadow entities from the
     local environment. Prefer qualified access.</LI>
  <LI> Avoid using library signatures in conjunction with non-library structures
  or functors. If in doubt, redefine them.</LI>
</UL>
