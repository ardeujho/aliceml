<?php section("overview", "overview") ?>

<P>The interactive top-level provides an interpreter-style environment that
allows entering and evaluating programs from an interactive prompt. It can
be run either as a text-based shell application or with a graphical user interface. The text-based interactive top-level is designed to work with the standard <A
href="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/contrib/emacs/">Emacs
mode</A> for SML. A patched version of that mode, modified to harmonize with
Alice ML syntax extensions, is also available from the Alice<A

page</A>.</P>

<?php section("description", "description") ?>

<P>The interactive top-level provides an interpreter-like read-eval-print loop.
In both, text mode and graphical mode, the system will - after preloading some components, show a prompt for its
interactive session. It allows entering arbitrary Alice components. Input
can stretch several lines, it is terminated by a line containing a semicolon as
its last character. The system will print the results and inferred types
for the given declarations, or an appropriate error message.</P>

<P>Nested and aggregated data structures are only printed up to certain depth and width limits. These can be controlled using the respective references from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module.</P>

<P>Values of abstract type are not printed. The <TT>register</TT> function from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module can be used to install simple user-defined printing functions for abstract types that the
top-level will use in its outputs.</P>

<P>Values of abstract type are not printed. The <TT>register</TT> function from the <A href="library/print.html"><TT>Print</TT></A> module can be used to install simple user-defined printing functions for abstract types that the
top-level will use in its outputs.</P>

<P>Note that the <TT>inspect</TT> function from the <A
href="library/inspector.html">Inspector</A> is available to browse complex
results conveniently.</P>

<?php subsection("description-use", "use") ?>

<P>Like in other SML systems, there also is the special purpose function</P>

<PRE class=code>
use : string -> unit</PRE>

<P>which, given the name of an Alice source file, will process this file as if
it had been fed as direct input.</P>

<?php subsection("description-import", "imports") ?>

<P>Each input in the interactive top-level actually is a <A
href="components.html">component</A>. This implies that import announcements
can be entered to link in separately compiled components from arbitrary
URIs:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- import structure Foo from "http://www.mydomain.net/Foo";
### loaded signature from http://www.mydomain.net/Foo
structure Foo : FOO = Foo
- </PRE>

<P>For convenience, it is possible to abbreviate import announcements as
follows in the interactive top-level:</P>

<PRE class=code>
- import "http://www.mydomain.net/Foo";
### loaded signature from http://www.mydomain.net/Foo
structure Foo : FOO = Foo
- </PRE>

<P>Such an announcement will import all items exported by the corresponding
component.</P>

<!--
<P>All <A href="library/index.html">library</A> components (except the <A
href="library/#gtk">GTK</A> library) are pre-imported in the interactive
top-level and will get loaded automatically on demand.</A>
-->

<?php section("text", "text interface") ?>

<P>In text mode, a computation can be interrupted using Ctrl-C (the Posix signal SIGINT).<!-- Likewise, typed input can be discarded with Ctrl-C.--></P>

<P>A running computation can also be put into background using Ctrl-Z (the Posix signal SIGTSTP, Ctrl-Break on Windows), getting you back to the prompt. The computation will proceed concurrently. Intuitively, the effect is roughly as if the initial input had been prefixed with <A href="futures.html#spawn"><TT>spawn</TT></A>. However, it works for arbitrary inputs, particularly declarations.</P>

<P>An interactive session can be terminated by typing an end-of-file character
(Ctrl-D on Unix systems, Ctrl-Z on Windows systems). Alternatively, the global function <TT>exit</TT> may be called.</P>

<DIV class=note>
<P><I>Note:</I> Depending on the shell used, the Ctrl sequences described above may not work as expected under Windows. We recommend using either zsh under Cygwin, or the SML mode for Emacs. A plain Windows command shell will also work. Bash and particularly tcsh are known to be problematic with respect to signal handling. Alternatively, you might use the graphical mode.
</P>
</DIV>

<P>A session can be reset by applying the global funciton <TT>reset</TT> (note that this does not kill any running threads).</P>


<?php section("gui", "graphical interface") ?>

<P>When started with the command line option <TT>-g</TT> (or <TT>--gui</TT>),
the interactive top-level comes with a graphical user interface (this is the
default when Alice is started from the system's graphical interface - e.g. the Start menu - instead of a shell). The graphical interface not only incorporates the input-eval-print window, but also an Alice ML program editor. Most of the interface is standard editor functionality and should be self-explanatory. We only describe the Alice specific features here.</P>

<P>The window is split into three panes (two intially):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The upper pane (initially closed) contains the editor and can open an arbitrary number of ML files in a tabbed text view.</LI>
  <LI>The middle pane is for interaction with the Alice top-level.</LI>
  <LI>The lower pane contains standard output and input streams of the Alice environment. Output on <TT>stdErr</TT> will be colored in red, while input by the user is shown in boldface.</LI>
</UL>
<P>With Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, and Ctrl-3 the input focus can be moved quickly between the three panes. The panes can be resized by mouse.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-interaction", "Interaction") ?>

<P>The interaction pane operates much like the interactive top-level in text mode: ML snippets can be entered that can span several lines and must be terminated by semicolon. In addition, previous inputs can be retrieved via the history commands from the <I>Eval</I> menu (or the shortcuts Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down). History is saved when the top-level is quit.</P>

<P>The <I>Interrupt</I> and <I>Background</I> commands from the <I>Eval</I> menu allow aborting the current computation or putting it into background. The whole interpreter environment can be reset from the menu, or by invoking <TT>reset()</TT> (note that this does not kill any running threads).</P>


<?php subsection("gui-feeding", "Feeding") ?>

<P>The <I>Eval</I> menu allows feeding portions of an editor window into the interactive session. This works in three ways:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>By selecting a region and invoking <I>Feed Region</I> (Ctrl-Return) the
  selected text will be fed into the interactive top-level as input.</LI>
  <LI>If nothing has been selected, invoking <I>Feed Region</I> will
  automatically select the <I>paragraph</I> surrounding the cursor, where
  a paragraph is a region of text delimited by empty lines.</LI>
  <LI>The whole file can be fed by invoking <I>Feed File</I> (Shift-Ctrl-Return).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Note that unlike direct input, fed input is not required to be terminated by a semicolon.</P>

<P>When input has been fed from a buffer, and an error occured, then selecting <I>Jump to Error</I> (Ctrl-E) from the <I>Edit</I> menu will immediately move the focus to the respective error location and select it.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-compilation", "Compilation") ?>

<P>By selecting <I>Compile</I> (Ctrl-K) from the <I>File</I> menu, the currently edited file can be compiled to a stand-alone component on disk. Eventual error messages will be printed on the interaction pane. Like with feeding, <I>Jump-to-Error</I> can be used to select the error region in case of an error.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-annotations", "Type information") ?>

<P>When feeding or compiling a buffer, the compiler collects type information about all identifiers found in the program (including type, module, or signature identifiers). This information will subsequently be displayed in the status bar whenever the cursor is positioned on an identifier in the respective buffer. In case that the information does not fit the single line of the status bar, the full information can be seen in a tooltip by moving the mouse pointer over the status bar.<P>

<P>Note that partial type information is available even if compilation failed with a type error - all types derived so far are displayed. However, compilation or feeding erases all previous type information about the buffer.</P>


<?php subsection("gui-session", "Session Management") ?>

<P>The GUI provides for simple session management: on startup, previously open files are re-opened, and the input history for the interaction pane is restored.</P>

<P>If "<TT>-</TT>" is given as a pseudo file name among the &lt;<I>input files</I>&gt; on the command line, then loading of files from the previous session is suppressed. Session reloading also can be deactivated altogether in the preferences.</P>
