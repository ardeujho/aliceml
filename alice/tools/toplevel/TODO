TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* on startup, shortcuts for cycling thru buffers are disabled (and syntax hilite)
* aliceglade ignores packing flags
  (manually replace alignment21's first Gtk.FILL by Gtk.EXPAND for text fields
   in search dialog to span full window)
* in/outdent shortcuts don't work on Windows (german keyboard)
* context menu doesn't display correctly (chinese Windows)
* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(

* reconsider implicit imports

Missing Features:

* extend `use' to support compiled components
* completion
* bookmarks?
* configure autoindent, tab expansion?
* propagate output width on init and after resize (requires Pango binding)
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
