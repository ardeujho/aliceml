The Alice Programming System

Alice is a functional programming language based on Standard ML,
extended with support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint
programming.

The Alice Programming System (APS) includes an interpreter-like
interactive toplevel, a batch compiler, a static linker, the
Inspector (a tool for dynamically inspecting Alice data
structures), the Explorer (a tool for interactively investigating
search problems), a binding for the Gnome toolkit GUI library,
and a comprehensive library.  The current release of the APS is
based on the Mozart virtual machine, which faciliates
interoperation between Alice and Oz (http://www.mozart-oz.org/).

The Alice Programming System is distributed under the terms and
conditions of the Alice License, a slight modification of the BSD
license.  See the file COPYING for details.
