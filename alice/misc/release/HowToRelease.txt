This file contains some notes about the preparation of an Alice release 
in general and about the release 1.3 in particular. 

==================

1. Phase: adjust version numbers in Alice CVS tree

The following files have to be adjusted:

alice/ALICEVERSION
alice/vm-seam/configure.ac
alice/lib/system/Config.aml.m4
alice/doc/manual/index.html
alice/misc/debian/configure.ac

seam/configure.ac
seam/debian/seam.info
seam/debian/seam.spec

Package information for RPM can be updated by calling "version.sh".
Package information for Debian can be updated by calling "changelog.sh"
Both scripts use "alicetool --package-version" as version number.

-----------

2. Phase: create a Seam build and source package (needed for Alice VM)

* download the Seam sources from CVS
* ./configure --prefix=<myseam-dst>
* make install
* make dist
* cp seam-1.3.tar.gz /services/ps/httpd/html/alice/download/sources

-----------

3. Phase: create a Gecode build (needed for Alice Gecode binding)
  
NOTE: This phase is optional if there is already a current Gecode version
      installed 
* download the gecode source from http://www.gecode.org
* extract the archive
* ./configure --prefix=<mygecode> --disable-examples
* make
* make install

----------

4. Phase: create an Alice build

* download the Alice sources from CVS
* cd alice
* make install 
  (* you may have to adjust the PKG_CONFIG_PATH manually for
* make dist-seam
* cp packages/* /services/ps/httpd/html/alice/download/sources


==> After these phases you successfully created source packages and you can
start to build binaries

----------

5.1 Phase: create Debian testing packages

Package building was prepared on tubi.ps.uni-sb.de
On this PC you can find a virtual machine for Debian testing that is
configured such that package building should be straightforward. 

* go to /local/tack/Debian testing
* vmplayer Debian\ testing.vmx starts the system
* user and password is "alice"
* In directory ~/release1.3 you can find debian packages that were already
  prepared. If you want to build new packages, because the sources changed,
  delete all files in this directory.
* in ~/release1.3 type "cp ../seam-support/linux/Makefile.debian ."
* make -f Makefile.debian should create all the packages
* Note that during the build process, several packages must be
  installed. Therefore you should start the Makefile as root (pw: alice). Do
  not forget to delete old packages. I can recommend synaptic. Just type
   "kdesu synaptic" in your shell and search for "alice"

The build process for other releases should be similiar.

----------

5.2 Phase: create rpm packages

Package building was prepared on tubi.ps.uni-sb.de
On this PC you can find a virtual machine for Fedora Core 5 that is configured
such that package building should be straightforward

* go to /local/tack/Fedora Core 5
* vmplayer Fedora\ Core\ 5.vmx starts the system
* user is "alice" and password "alicefedora"
* In directory ~/release1.3 you can find rpm packages that were already
  prepared. If you want to build new packages, because the sources changed,
  delete all files in this directory.
* copy ~/seam-support/linux/build-rpm, ~/seam-support/linux/Makefile.rpm, and
  to ~/release1.3 type
* Before you start the build process, you have to ensure that the current
  Gecode release was installed via rpm. In ~/gecode-rpms you can find a
  description (that is also available at ~/seam-support/linux)
* log in as root (pw: alicefedora) and go to /home/alice/release1.3
* make -f Makefile.rpm should create all the packages

The build process for other releases should be similiar.

----------

5.3 Phase: create Windows packages
    TODO: add a description

---------

6. Phase: test packages

The built packages should be tested. Install them on a test system, or
directly check them in the VMs described above. Up to now, I only did the
following tests:

* "alice -g": This starts the GUI Toplevel
* test some commands, for instance 
  "import "x-alice:/lib/tools/Explorer; Explorer.exploreAll (const ());"

Further testing is recommended.

---------

7. Phase: upload packages
   TODO: add description
   wild guess: copy packages into /services/ps/httpd/html/alice/download/???

--------

8. Phase: install documentation
   
Install the new manual on the web server.
