On Windows, if you have Cygwin, proceed as described in INSTALL. Otherwise,
you have to install the SML mode by hand.

1) Go to your Emacs installation directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\Emacs).

2) In the site-lisp subdirectory, create a new directory named sml-mode.

3) Copy all *.el files to it.

4) In the site-lisp subdirectory, edit the file site-start.el and add the
   following two lines:

	(add-to-list 'load-path "C:/Program Files/Emacs/site-lisp/sml-mode")
	(load "sml-mode/sml-mode-startup")

   (Adapt the path to your installation directory.)

Optionally, to add the sml-mode documentation to the Emacs info system:

5) Copy sml-mode.info to the info subdirectory.
