- Reimplement recomputable spaces: MkRSpace.aml

- Remember, you have sleepms in MkWorker

- When generative types are back, look for ??? in MkEngine.

- HANDLE exceptions in THREADS. See MkWorker for inspiration.
  Also find WHO should fail : the manager, the worker, both ???
  In particular when a call to 'share' raises an exception.

- Write (all?) the interfaces
